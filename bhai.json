To simulate the valence quark flavors, we employ a combination of lattice actions adapted to their masses: the NRQCD action is used for bottom quarks, the anisotropic Clover action is adopted for charm quarks, and the $\\mathcal{O}(a)$-improved Wilson-Clover action is used for strange and lighter (up\/down) quarks. The strange quark masses are tuned to match the lattice value for the fictitious $\\eta_s (\\bar ss)$ pseudoscalar meson mass with 688.5 MeV. The bare bottom quark mass is tuned by equating the kinetic mass, while the bare charm quark mass is tuned using the pole mass of the respective heavy-strange meson with the physical values. Heavy hadron operators with at least one bottom quark are constructed by considering all possible combinations with charm, strange, and light quarks. We investigate ground state masses for all different bottom mesons and bottom baryons with various quantum numbers.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137885\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sabiar","last_name":"Shaikh","fullName":"Shaikh, Sabiar","id":"262383","affiliation":"National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar","emailHash":"349f8fc3928f07a36dfe76a75987e698","db_id":262383,"person_id":225720}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sabiar","last_name":"Shaikh","fullName":"Shaikh, Sabiar","id":"262383","affiliation":"National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar","emailHash":"349f8fc3928f07a36dfe76a75987e698","db_id":262383,"person_id":225720},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Protick","last_name":"Mohanta","fullName":"Mohanta, Protick","id":"262381","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai","emailHash":"676099dde1692a51a5845a2f734ef008","db_id":262381,"person_id":225719},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Subhasish","last_name":"Basak","fullName":"Basak, Subhasish","id":"262384","affiliation":"National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar","emailHash":"a29f19f255e323ab187f6ce419165125","db_id":262384,"person_id":220284},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Padmanath","last_name":"Madanagopalan","fullName":"Madanagopalan, Padmanath","id":"262382","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai","emailHash":"c80160234c65f790c98fc0e967a67023","db_id":262382,"person_id":210658}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"52","db_id":137883,"friendly_id":52,"title":"Precisely determining the ground state mass of Spin-3\/2 $\\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon from Lattice QCD","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG66","room":"AG66","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present the most precise determination to date of the ground-state masses of the triply charmed baryons with both parities, obtained by continuum extrapolation from two complementary lattice setups and thus fully addressing the systematic uncertainties.

The calculations are performed on two ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\\pi} \\approx 280\\,\\text{MeV}$, lattice spacing $a \\approx 0.09\\,\\text{fm}$, and spatial extents $L\/a = 24$ and $32$. The two-meson spectrum in the finite volume is determined for the $DD_s$, $DD_s^*$, $D^*D_s$, and $D^*D_s^*$ channels. This is achieved through a variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices constructed using a large basis of bilocal two-meson operators within the distillation framework. To extract the infinite-volume amplitudes, we employ L\u00fcscher\u2019s formalism as well as a Lippmann-Schwinger equation based quantization condition in a plane-wave basis. Despite the presence of nontrivial interactions in both channels, no non-spurious pole singularities are found in the S-wave amplitudes within the constrained energy region.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137879\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tanishk","last_name":"Shrimal","fullName":"Shrimal, Tanishk","id":"262364","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences","emailHash":"811d05f11b68f9a096eb0ceb5099bffa","db_id":262364,"person_id":216060}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tanishk","last_name":"Shrimal","fullName":"Shrimal, Tanishk","id":"262364","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences","emailHash":"811d05f11b68f9a096eb0ceb5099bffa","db_id":262364,"person_id":216060}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"M.","last_name":"Padmanath","fullName":"Padmanath, M.","id":"262360","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences Chennai","emailHash":"c80160234c65f790c98fc0e967a67023","db_id":262360,"person_id":210658},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Priyajit","last_name":"Jana","fullName":"Jana, Priyajit","id":"262363","affiliation":"IISER Kolkata","emailHash":null,"db_id":262363,"person_id":216063},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sara","last_name":"Collins","fullName":"Collins, Sara","id":"262362","affiliation":"Institute for theoretical physics, University of Regensburg","emailHash":"1f897719dbddc0ee4b2e09a3c9d057d2","db_id":262362,"person_id":216062},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sasa","last_name":"Prelovsek Komelj","fullName":"Prelovsek Komelj, Sasa","id":"262361","affiliation":"","emailHash":"2f32b246e77d3acf1c685d078c091d5d","db_id":262361,"person_id":216061}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"245","db_id":137878,"friendly_id":245,"title":"Charm tetraquarks investigation using CLS lattices","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG66","room":"AG66","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"I will summarize various lattice investigations of charmed and charmonium tetraquarks using CLS lattice QCD ensembles that we have performed in the past one year.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137878\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"M.","last_name":"Padmanath","fullName":"Padmanath, M.","id":"262359","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences Chennai","emailHash":"c80160234c65f790c98fc0e967a67023","db_id":262359,"person_id":210658}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"M.","last_name":"Padmanath","fullName":"Padmanath, M.","id":"262359","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences Chennai","emailHash":"c80160234c65f790c98fc0e967a67023","db_id":262359,"person_id":210658}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"33","db_id":137881,"friendly_id":33,"title":"$T_{cc}$ pole trajectory","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG66","room":"AG66","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The recent discovery of $T_{cc}$ has attracted several lattice QCD\r\nas well as other studies of $T_{cc}$ pole.

To accurately determine its finite-volume spectrum, a variational analysis using a large basis of operators, including bilocal scattering operators but also local tetraquark operators, should be used. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point, we investigated the importance of local tetraquark operators for the $T_{cc}$ spectrum by adding them to a large basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators. We performed this calculation using the distillation framework combined with a position-space sampling method[ \\[arXiv:2412.09246\\]][1]. Upon including the local tetraquark operators, we observe a relatively small shift in the ground state energy, whereas the first excited state shifts significantly.

This approach relies on analyticity and unitarity of the $S$-matrix to relate infinite-volume scattering amplitudes to finite-volume energy levels. However, lattice QCD simulations employing rooted staggered fermions manifest unitarity violation as an $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ lattice artifact. Moreover, the meson sector of this theory contains multiple pions as a result of taste-splitting effects. These features restrict the applicability of the L\u00fcscher formalism on observables computed using staggered fermions. Backed by calculations in the corresponding effective theory--Staggered Chiral Perturbation Theory--in this work, we discuss possible approaches to deal with the challenges of extracting scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD with staggered quarks. In particular, we focus on the simpler case of pion-pion scattering in the isospin-2 channel, and discuss prospects for other channels.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137877\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Adeilton

For instance, the form factors of these states can be found via analytic continuation of the two-particle transition rate induced by the current of interest. These transitions, in turn, can be constrained from finite volume spectra and matrix elements, which can be obtained from a lattice calculation. In this talk we will describe the procedure to connect finite volume data to infinite volume transitions, and apply it to a non-relativistic toy model lattice theory. This toy model features a bound state whose binding energy can be tuned from a state close to threshold to deeply bound. We find that the finite volume effect in matrix elements becomes more significant as the binding energy decreases. Finally, we show that these effects can be corrected with the framework describing the volume dependence of the nearby two-particle channel.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137888\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"Ortega Gama","fullName":"Ortega Gama, Felipe","id":"262395","affiliation":"UC Berkeley","emailHash":"eafe0c0ea4b619bbbb301af0d6859662","db_id":262395,"person_id":225700}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Moscoso","fullName":"Moscoso, Joseph","id":"262396","affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","emailHash":"c81f75e423f0b8710ed2eef97beb7228","db_id":262396,"person_id":225699}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"Ortega Gama","fullName":"Ortega Gama, Felipe","id":"262395","affiliation":"UC Berkeley","emailHash":"eafe0c0ea4b619bbbb301af0d6859662","db_id":262395,"person_id":225700}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Romero L\u00f3pez","firstName":"Fernando","name":"Romero L\u00f3pez, Fernando","last_name":"Romero L\u00f3pez","first_name":"Fernando","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Uni Bern","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Romero L\u00f3pez, Fernando","id":219632,"db_id":12715,"person_id":219632,"emailHash":"67ed48f5c94fb78218b91bbe6954b9b0"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Mai","firstName":"Maxim","name":"Mai, Maxim","last_name":"Mai","first_name":"Maxim","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Bern","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Mai, Maxim","id":220003,"db_id":12713,"person_id":220003,"emailHash":"f3452df5ab50854cd2977b0dcef48ded"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Paul","firstName":"Srijit","name":"Paul, Srijit","last_name":"Paul","first_name":"Srijit","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Paul, Srijit","id":220283,"db_id":12717,"person_id":220283,"emailHash":"bf2d078296cdc9104f9200f1301a46b3"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Heller","firstName":"Urs","name":"Heller, Urs","last_name":"Heller","first_name":"Urs","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Physical Review D, American Physical Society","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Heller, Urs","id":223063,"db_id":12721,"person_id":223063,"emailHash":"fe22309340df0c2e8b899d2b29efd0e1"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Nicholson","firstName":"Amy","name":"Nicholson, Amy","last_name":"Nicholson","first_name":"Amy","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"UNC Chapel Hill","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Nicholson, Amy","id":225311,"db_id":12722,"person_id":225311,"emailHash":"09393edecee68e57d3288d1a70f6819f"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Perry","firstName":"Robert","name":"Perry, Robert","last_name":"Perry","first_name":"Robert","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Perry, Robert","id":225761,"db_id":12723,"person_id":225761,"emailHash":"87b2c7b2da98d7463eb5a400a35c607d"}],"title":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","color":"#1a3f14","textColor":"#f1ffef","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20933\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin -

Owing to the absence of quark-antiquark annihilation, the Dbar-N channel is an entirely exotic channel, such that a bound state would correspond to a pentaquark state. While some EFT models predict a strong attraction that could form a pentaquark state, other models suggest only weak attraction or even repulsion, implying no such state [1-5]. Realistic lattice QCD simulations can thus play a crucial role in clarifying the existence (or absence) of a pentaquark state in the Dbar-N channel.\r\nIn this talk, we present results for the Dbar-N potential and its s-wave scattering parameters obtained using the HAL QCD method [6,7] . (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations were performed at the physical point with gauge configurations generated by the HAL QCD Collaboration (\u201cHAL-conf-2023\u201d [8]) on a $96^3 \\times 96$ lattice with a pion mass $m_\\pi \\simeq 137$ MeV and lattice spacing $a \\simeq 0.0844$ fm. We observe an attractive phase shift in the low-energy region of the I=0 channel and a repulsive phase shift in the I=1 channel. Our results indicate the absence of pentaquark states in both I=0 and I=1 channels.\r\n\r\n[1] J. Hoffman, M.F.M. Lutz, Nucl. Phys. A 763 (2005) 90-139\r\n[2] J. Haidenbauer, G. Krein, U.-G.

Although kaon-nucleon scattering experiments have been performed since the 1960s, our understanding of the interactions remains limited due to a lack of experimental data at low momenta, making it difficult to accurately elucidate the related physics. On the other hand, recent developments in computational power and lattice QCD techniques have enabled a precise determination of hadron interactions from first principles. In this study, we investigate the S-wave kaon-nucleon interactions in lattice QCD using the time-dependent HAL QCD method. The calculation is performed with $N_f=2+1$ quark flavors at the physical point, $m_{\\pi}\\approx 137$ MeV, using the configurations generated by HAL QCD Collaboration, \u201cHAL-conf-2023\u201d.\r\nThe resulting interaction potential exhibits a purely repulsive behavior for isospin $I=1$, while for $I=0$ a slight attractive pocket is observed in addition to repulsion. The obtained scattering observables are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results. Particularly, our results suggest the P-wave dominance at low momentum for $I=0$. Furthermore, our results indicate that there are no bound or resonant states corresponding to the $\\Theta^{+}$ pentaquark in this system.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137896\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kotaro","last_name":"Murakami","fullName":"Murakami, Kotaro","id":"262417","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e61dc114409c8b63223f8d317685e2ec","db_id":262417,"person_id":225596}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kotaro","last_name":"Murakami","fullName":"Murakami, Kotaro","id":"262417","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e61dc114409c8b63223f8d317685e2ec","db_id":262417,"person_id":225596},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sinya","last_name":"Aoki","fullName":"Aoki, Sinya","id":"262418","affiliation":"","emailHash":"3772fe42f8d83c85ad65d4da5083f594","db_id":262418,"person_id":225598},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Takumi","last_name":"Doi","fullName":"Doi, Takumi","id":"262419","affiliation":"","emailHash":"8b795ddc942c66e89401b92cc7717e09","db_id":262419,"person_id":225597},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yan","last_name":"Lyu","fullName":"Lyu, Yan","id":"262421","affiliation":"","emailHash":"727118996c1852c9cd2443db2df6ceab","db_id":262421,"person_id":225595},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wren","last_name":"Yamada","fullName":"Yamada, Wren","id":"262420","affiliation":"RIKEN","emailHash":"ef5aad67c72af3166b12904f6627bcbb","db_id":262420,"person_id":225599}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"17","db_id":137899,"friendly_id":17,"title":"Negative parity hyperons from coupled channel scattering","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG66","room":"AG66","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The experimentally challenging J^P=1\/2^- hyperons are investigated by computing meson-baryon scattering on the lattice.

Chiral perturbation theory predicts that its experimental spectrum may be explained by a two pole structure originating in the $SU(3)$ chiral dynamics of the baryon-meson interaction. The $SU(3)$-symmetric flavor point is readily accessible in lattice QCD, in this work we study the baryon-meson states directly at this point. We construct interpolation operators that belong to the irreducible representations of $SU(3)$ that are attractive in the channel with the quantum numbers of the $\\Lambda (1405)$ (singlet and two octets). The extracted energy levels can be used as input for chiral perturbation theory to find the poles associated with each representation. The relevant correlation functions are computed on $SU(3)$-symmetric ensembles with $M_\\pi \\approx 714 MeV $ using the distillation technique.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137897\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Javier","last_name":"Suarez Sucunza","fullName":"Suarez Sucunza, Javier","id":"262422","affiliation":"University Bonn","emailHash":"80841a27711bc6b19695589f78d7e60e","db_id":262422,"person_id":225650}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carsten","last_name":"Urbach","fullName":"Urbach, Carsten","id":"262424","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"67263c5ac77e1342e7cdca171e9d5a95","db_id":262424,"person_id":224541},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Javier","last_name":"Suarez Sucunza","fullName":"Suarez Sucunza, Javier","id":"262422","affiliation":"University Bonn","emailHash":"80841a27711bc6b19695589f78d7e60e","db_id":262422,"person_id":225650},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Luu","fullName":"Luu, Thomas","id":"262423","affiliation":"Forshungszentrum J\u00fclich","emailHash":"e7b0859c28cff415e075ec67ec9fec5d","db_id":262423,"person_id":224678}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Romero L\u00f3pez","firstName":"Fernando","name":"Romero L\u00f3pez, Fernando","last_name":"Romero L\u00f3pez","first_name":"Fernando","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Uni Bern","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Romero L\u00f3pez, Fernando","id":219632,"db_id":12715,"person_id":219632,"emailHash":"67ed48f5c94fb78218b91bbe6954b9b0"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Mai","firstName":"Maxim","name":"Mai, Maxim","last_name":"Mai","first_name":"Maxim","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Bern","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Mai, Maxim","id":220003,"db_id":12713,"person_id":220003,"emailHash":"f3452df5ab50854cd2977b0dcef48ded"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Paul","firstName":"Srijit","name":"Paul, Srijit","last_name":"Paul","first_name":"Srijit","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Paul, Srijit","id":220283,"db_id":12717,"person_id":220283,"emailHash":"bf2d078296cdc9104f9200f1301a46b3"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Heller","firstName":"Urs","name":"Heller, Urs","last_name":"Heller","first_name":"Urs","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Physical Review D, American Physical Society","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Heller, Urs","id":223063,"db_id":12721,"person_id":223063,"emailHash":"fe22309340df0c2e8b899d2b29efd0e1"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Nicholson","firstName":"Amy","name":"Nicholson, Amy","last_name":"Nicholson","first_name":"Amy","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"UNC Chapel Hill","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Nicholson, Amy","id":225311,"db_id":12722,"person_id":225311,"emailHash":"09393edecee68e57d3288d1a70f6819f"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Perry","firstName":"Robert","name":"Perry, Robert","last_name":"Perry","first_name":"Robert","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Perry, Robert","id":225761,"db_id":12723,"person_id":225761,"emailHash":"87b2c7b2da98d7463eb5a400a35c607d"}],"title":"Hadronic and nuclear spectrum and interactions","color":"#1a3f14","textColor":"#f1ffef","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20933\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin -

Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $m_\\pi \\approx$ 280 MeV, are used and an operator set comprised of two-hadron, three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1\/2$ $D\\pi$ two-body subsystems.

I present results on the  key nonperturbative gauge-invariant correlators to be computed on lattice QCD\u2014such as static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, and adjoint mesons\u2014for understanding the patterns of XYZ states. Moreover, I show for the first time new results on the behavior of static energies at short distances and mixing with the threshold at long distances based on BOEFT.

Our approach involves calculating correlators among three operator classes: (i) static-light pair, (ii) quarkonium plus pions, and (iii) the novel interpolator based on BOEFT (Born\u2013Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory) proposed in Ref. [1]. We use the GEVP variational approach to extract the preliminary eigenenergies and overlap factors from the correlation matrix. At short distances, at leading order, this novel interpolator has zero overlap with quarkonium and pions due to the $Q\\bar{Q}$ pair being in a color-octet configuration, whereas at large distances it conveniently evolves into a heavy-light pair, making it a suitable choice to calculate the tetraquark static energies on the lattice. To achieve this, we employ the distillation technique on a CLS ensemble with $N_f=2+1$ and $m_{\\pi}=290$ MeV.\r\n\r\nIn the limit of zero spatial separation between the static quark and antiquark, the diagonal correlator associated with the novel interpolator reduces to the correlator of an adjoint meson, i.e., a state composed of a static adjoint source bound to a light quark\u2013antiquark pair. We will present the preliminary spectrum of the corresponding $I=1$ adjoint mesons in the scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector channels. For this, we use $N_f=3+1$ ensembles produced with the openQCD package [2], with $m_{\\pi}=406$ MeV, $N_{\\sigma}=32$, and $N_\\tau=96$, with open boundary conditions in time. \r\n\r\n[1] Matthias Berwein, Nora Brambilla, Abhishek Mohapatra, and Antonio Vairo.

We show preliminary results for the continuum extrapolation of the step- scaling function. Compared with other finite volume approaches, we expect a reduced statistical error due to the translational invariance of the boundary conditions, and a smooth approach to the continuum limit without linear cutoff effects, thanks to an improved setup with good scaling properties.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137796\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Isabella","last_name":"Leone Zimmel","fullName":"Leone Zimmel, Isabella","id":"262047","affiliation":"","emailHash":"6cba3d8575c07e3c8e0916573202722f","db_id":262047,"person_id":225885}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"Ramos Martinez","fullName":"Ramos Martinez, Alberto","id":"262048","affiliation":"Univ. of Valencia and CSIC (ES)","emailHash":"c8d6f3e3070d6e6f3cb04d823e89d7c4","db_id":262048,"person_id":225239},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Isabella","last_name":"Leone Zimmel","fullName":"Leone Zimmel, Isabella","id":"262047","affiliation":"","emailHash":"6cba3d8575c07e3c8e0916573202722f","db_id":262047,"person_id":225885}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Standard Model parameters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"126","db_id":137794,"friendly_id":126,"title":"Strong coupling constant from the static energy","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG77","room":"AG77","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ can be obtained from the static energy.

It explains the concept of universality whereby dimensionless renormalized observables approach the same continuum value in any discretization. The functional form of these observables as functions of the lattice spacing depends on the anomalous dimensions of the involved operators and can be quite complicated. In order to state precision results in lattice field theory, we claim it is crucial to assure oneself that universality holds and that the simulation is performed in a parameter region where the continuum approach is asymptotic. Using quantities derived from the gradient flow, we perform such a test in pure gauge theory. In this talk, we report on the results from this study and demonstrate, how one can easily draw incorrect conclusions from flow-time ratios and propose a more careful method.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137797\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"Lang","fullName":"Lang, Nicolas","id":"262049","affiliation":"IFIC, U.

The resulting quark masses are obtained with good precision, with subdominant systematic uncertainties that differ from, and thus complement, those of standard large-volume determinations.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137801\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Kuberski","fullName":"Kuberski, Simon","id":"262089","affiliation":"","emailHash":"bc3f69a788260c4d9012563d58bc7e2c","db_id":262089,"person_id":224711}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Kuberski","fullName":"Kuberski, Simon","id":"262089","affiliation":"","emailHash":"bc3f69a788260c4d9012563d58bc7e2c","db_id":262089,"person_id":224711},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Conigli","fullName":"Conigli, Alessandro","id":"262091","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Institut Mainz","emailHash":null,"db_id":262091,"person_id":216328},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Fritzsch","fullName":"Fritzsch, Patrick","id":"262092","affiliation":"","emailHash":"2fdcccfe3858f5bf05592a7f4fe7b422","db_id":262092,"person_id":225521},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Antoine","last_name":"G\u00e9rardin","fullName":"G\u00e9rardin, Antoine","id":"262096","affiliation":"CPT Marseille","emailHash":"95146b47f0338b16d877693678f51abf","db_id":262096,"person_id":225517},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jochen","last_name":"Heitger","fullName":"Heitger, Jochen","id":"262097","affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster, ITP","emailHash":"22f99f4de8a7d71404534b5095e2168d","db_id":262097,"person_id":225519},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gregorio","last_name":"Herdoiza","fullName":"Herdoiza, Gregorio","id":"262093","affiliation":"","emailHash":"65e5e59b0e33ae02518a872dcb2cb120","db_id":262093,"person_id":216325},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Pena Ruano","fullName":"Pena Ruano, Carlos","id":"262094","affiliation":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (ES)","emailHash":"86ed60a765e7b40703f61e2d5e95f26d","db_id":262094,"person_id":225520},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hubert","last_name":"Simma","fullName":"Simma, Hubert","id":"262095","affiliation":"","emailHash":null,"db_id":262095,"person_id":225522},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rainer","last_name":"Sommer","fullName":"Sommer, Rainer","id":"262090","affiliation":"","emailHash":"afbcb827c2a8ef2a19bd854b5a9377d7","db_id":262090,"person_id":225518}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Standard Model parameters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"204","db_id":137798,"friendly_id":204,"title":"RG running and mixing for  $\\Delta$F = 2 Four-Fermion Operators from Step-Scaling Matrices in $\\chi$SF schemes","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"04:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"04:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG77","room":"AG77","note":{},"location":"","type":null,"description":"We show preliminary results for the nonperturbative Renormalization Group (RG) running of the full $\\Delta F=2$ four-fermion operators basis in QCD with $N_f=3$ massless dynamical flavours.

This cost is highly dependent on the observable of interest and the details of its representation, including any approximation needed to estimate it, aside from the sampling algorithm used for the fields. Moreover, the variance of such estimators may depend strongly on physical parameters such as the lattice spacing and volume, which gives an important insight into the cost of reaching the relevant physical limits. In this talk, I will review some observables involving quark propagators, in particular quark connected and disconnected diagrams, and discuss variance-reduction schemes based on decompositions of the propagators. Such strategies have already proven useful for precision physics observables and in future may help reduce the computational cost of approaching large volumes.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137029\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Harris","fullName":"Harris, Tim","id":"260551","affiliation":"","emailHash":"1c8748c6d281675870bc8c960bfc7026","db_id":260551,"person_id":225672}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Harris","fullName":"Harris, Tim","id":"260551","affiliation":"","emailHash":"1c8748c6d281675870bc8c960bfc7026","db_id":260551,"person_id":225672}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Plenary session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"110","db_id":136739,"friendly_id":110,"title":"Renormalization group on tensor networks","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"05:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"06:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Tensor networks provide novel formulations of lattice field theories, which in turn enable the development of practically efficient renormalization group methods.

However, the advent of quantum computation, quantum simulation, and advanced tensor network methods has created new opportunities and demands for a Hamiltonian approach, which is better suited for describing real-time dynamics and operating directly on states belonging to the physical Hilbert space.\r\nIn this talk, we review some of these recently developed formalisms that are of active interest to the lattice community. Following this overview, we provide a detailed exposition of the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) framework and demonstrate how LSH reformulates the theory in an explicitly gauge-invariant basis of electric flux loops and open strings connecting matter fields, which naturally map to hadronic states. This choice of basis offers a physically intuitive and computationally efficient Hilbert space truncation. We also highlight its direct applications, highlighting how eliminating redundant gauge degrees of freedom makes exact diagonalisation and tensor network calculations feasible to study real-time dynamics, provide insights about thermalization properties, enable mapping of physical degrees of freedom on analog and digital quantum hardware - followed by quantum simulation of dynamics. We will also present how the basis more effectively captures the entanglement structure of the theory.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/136885\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Indrakshi","last_name":"Raychowdhury","fullName":"Raychowdhury, Indrakshi","id":"260071","affiliation":"","emailHash":"05dec3d473d099bfd859a2701721df68","db_id":260071,"person_id":225543}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Indrakshi","last_name":"Raychowdhury","fullName":"Raychowdhury, Indrakshi","id":"260071","affiliation":"","emailHash":"05dec3d473d099bfd859a2701721df68","db_id":260071,"person_id":225543}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Plenary session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"04:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"08:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Kronfeld","firstName":"Andreas","name":"Kronfeld, Andreas","last_name":"Kronfeld","first_name":"Andreas","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Lab.

The non-perturbative nature of these theories makes lattice field theory the natural tool for computing the associated physical observables. After a brief overview of widely-studied proposals for strongly coupled theories in the context of beyond the Standard Model physics, in this talk, I  focus on Higgs compositeness and top partial compositeness. Primarily, I discuss the Sp(4) gauge theory with matter consisting of two fundamental and three antisymmetric fermions, detailing its motivations as a template for this class of models. I  present recent results from the TELOS collaboration on the mass spectrum of the model, emphasizing methodological advances that have broader applicability to lattice QCD studies. Finally, I discuss finite-temperature calculations in Sp(4) gauge theories with and without fermionic matter, and the potential relevance of associated phase transitions as sources of a stochastic relic density of gravitational waves.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/136738\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Biagio","last_name":"Lucini","fullName":"Lucini, Biagio","id":"259925","affiliation":"Queen Mary University of London (UK)","emailHash":"a81a3ff4df4ba95eed8430082d6fd22c","db_id":259925,"person_id":224190}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Biagio","last_name":"Lucini","fullName":"Lucini, Biagio","id":"259925","affiliation":"Queen Mary University of London (UK)","emailHash":"a81a3ff4df4ba95eed8430082d6fd22c","db_id":259925,"person_id":224190}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Plenary session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"301","db_id":138237,"friendly_id":301,"title":"TBA","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"07:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"08:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":null,"description":"","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138237\/","material":[],"speakers":[],"primaryauthors":[],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Plenary session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"04:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"08:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Kronfeld","firstName":"Andreas","name":"Kronfeld, Andreas","last_name":"Kronfeld","first_name":"Andreas","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Lab.

A key quantity in this context is the QCD Equation of State. I present a non-perturbative determination with three massless quark flavors, covering a wide range of temperatures, from the electroweak scale down to 3 GeV, and smoothly connecting to the low-temperature regime. The comparison with perturbative predictions shows that, even at temperatures approaching the electroweak scale, the Equation of State can be reproduced only when adding higher-order terms in the strong coupling expansion, including non-perturbative contributions.\r\nThe strategy that allows the investigation of QCD in this previously unexplored high-temperature regime combines shifted boundary conditions with a definition of the lines of constant physics based on the running of a non-perturbatively defined renormalized coupling. This methodology is general and can be applied to QCD with four or five massive quark flavors.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137162\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Pepe","fullName":"Pepe, Michele","id":"260778","affiliation":"INFN - National Institute for Nuclear Physics","emailHash":"f50da4ff6579de0e75352a64a6831b3e","db_id":260778,"person_id":225392}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Pepe","fullName":"Pepe, Michele","id":"260778","affiliation":"INFN - National Institute for Nuclear Physics","emailHash":"f50da4ff6579de0e75352a64a6831b3e","db_id":260778,"person_id":225392}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Plenary session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"04:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-08","time":"08:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Kronfeld","firstName":"Andreas","name":"Kronfeld, Andreas","last_name":"Kronfeld","first_name":"Andreas","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Lab.

The main idea is to apply a sequence of canonical transformations that rewrite the standard link variables of $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories in terms of the loop variables. This allows an easier handling of gauge-invariant degrees of freedom and gives a cleaner way to define subsystems on the lattice. We work in spin-network basis and test the construction on simple states to understand how the reduced density matrix can be defined in this framework. The analysis is general for $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$. The work is still in progress, and I plan to present the structure of the formulation, along with some preliminary results and open issues.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137808\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Adarsh","last_name":"S.","fullName":"S., Adarsh","id":"262116","affiliation":"National Institute of Technology Calicut","emailHash":"4c7d630e120d4963be05e3c2e95593a4","db_id":262116,"person_id":225745}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Adarsh","last_name":"S.","fullName":"S., Adarsh","id":"262116","affiliation":"National Institute of Technology Calicut","emailHash":"4c7d630e120d4963be05e3c2e95593a4","db_id":262116,"person_id":225745},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sreeraj","last_name":"T.P.","fullName":"T.P., Sreeraj","id":"262115","affiliation":"National Institute of Technology Calicut","emailHash":"ccf83f4f2be6924724cf14aa7a1872f1","db_id":262115,"person_id":225746}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Vacuum structure and confinement","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"222","db_id":137810,"friendly_id":222,"title":"Neural-network parametrized ground state optimization for the static quark-antiquark pair","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG77","room":"AG77","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The extraction of the static quark-antiquark potential from lattice QCD suffers from the poor signal-to-noise ratio of Wilson loops at large Euclidean times. To overcome this, smearing methods or the Coulomb gauge are used to improve the ground-state overlap with respect to the straight Wilson line trial state within the Wilson loop. We introduce a neural-network parametrization of trial states, constructed with gauge-equivariant layers and optimized with a loss function that favors the ground state. In quenched theory, our method achieves improved overlap compared to standard Wilson loops and is competitive with Wilson line correlators in Coulomb gauge. We further extend the framework to access excited states and outline a systematic strategy for their extraction.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137810\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Mayer-Steudte","fullName":"Mayer-Steudte, Julian","id":"262122","affiliation":"","emailHash":"ef17389b0f18d177cabb88d4e880fc05","db_id":262122,"person_id":225454}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Mayer-Steudte","fullName":"Mayer-Steudte, Julian","id":"262122","affiliation":"","emailHash":"ef17389b0f18d177cabb88d4e880fc05","db_id":262122,"person_id":225454}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Kronfeld","fullName":"Kronfeld, Andreas","id":"262121","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Lab.

A finite-size scaling of the ensemble-averaged simplicity of Abelian magnetic monopole currents provides the expected value of the critical coupling with an accuracy that is generally higher than that obtained with conventional thermodynamic approaches at comparable statistics.

A recent next-to-leading\u2013order derivation within the Effective String Theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the corrections proportional to the baryon--junction mass $M$, up to order $1\/R^2$ (where $R$ is the length of the confining strings), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination.  One of the main goals of this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov-loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon\u2013junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1\/R^{2}$ term in the open-string channel, we obtain the value $\\frac{M}{\\sqrt{\\sigma}} = 0.1355(36)\r\n$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used\r\nto describe a hadron. In addition, studying the high temperature behaviour of the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky--Yaffe conjecture for the $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ theory in three dimensions.  Focusing on the high-temperature regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov-loop correlators with the quantitative predictions obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three-state Potts model in two dimensions, and find excellent agreement.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137804\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dario","last_name":"Panfalone","fullName":"Panfalone, Dario","id":"262104","affiliation":"","emailHash":"9741405725aebcd504f22dfe0ef4809a","db_id":262104,"person_id":218187}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dario","last_name":"Panfalone","fullName":"Panfalone, Dario","id":"262104","affiliation":"","emailHash":"9741405725aebcd504f22dfe0ef4809a","db_id":262104,"person_id":218187},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"Verzichelli","fullName":"Verzichelli, Lorenzo","id":"262102","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 di Torino, INFN sezione di Torino","emailHash":"58e279146ce76f7e055d4a9208ddaf8e","db_id":262102,"person_id":218185},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Caselle","fullName":"Caselle, Michele","id":"262105","affiliation":"","emailHash":"423e1df6432dec5576fc1c8e381c5d92","db_id":262105,"person_id":218186},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicodemo","last_name":"Magnoli","fullName":"Magnoli, Nicodemo","id":"262103","affiliation":"University of Genoa and INFN","emailHash":"17db0fd7a2c7a206b9f655f2bc36cdd0","db_id":262103,"person_id":220585}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Vacuum structure and confinement","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[],"title":"Vacuum structure and confinement","color":"#ecc495","textColor":"#1f1100","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20942\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":3,"id":"23","db_id":20942,"friendly_id":23,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"AG77","roomFullname":"AG77","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24706,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Traditionally, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods used to study these systems often exhibit slow convergence, critical slowing down, and poor mixing, resulting in highly correlated samples. Machine learning\u2013based sampling approaches, such as normalising flows (NFs), are being extensively used in conjunction with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to produce unbiased samples. This talk discusses several shortcomings of NFs and some of our solutions for them. Often, especially in high-dimensional lattices, the target distributions are multi-modal, i.e., they have multiple high-probability regions (also known as modes) separated by low-probability barriers. In NF, reverse KL training leads to mode collapse (learning only a few modes), whereas forward KL training induces mode-covering behaviour (producing samples from low-probability regions). Moreover, forward KL training relies on MCMC-generated samples, which increases the computational costs. We propose two approaches: an adversarial learning approach (AdvNF) and a score-based learning approach (ScoreNF), demonstrating their effectiveness and efficiency on multiple benchmark datasets, including the mixture of Gaussians, the XY model, and the scalar \u03c6\u2074 theory.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138394\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vikas","last_name":"Kanaujia","fullName":"Kanaujia, Vikas","id":"263665","affiliation":"IIT Kanpur","emailHash":"07fc9188fd68e0ba8b945075e5b40a8e","db_id":263665,"person_id":227702},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vipu","last_name":"Arora","fullName":"Arora, Vipu","id":"263666","affiliation":"IIT Kanpur and KU Leuven","emailHash":"1a88ef755ce8b92148a02c9f7ad7d1f0","db_id":263666,"person_id":227701}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vikas","last_name":"Kanaujia","fullName":"Kanaujia, Vikas","id":"263665","affiliation":"IIT Kanpur","emailHash":"07fc9188fd68e0ba8b945075e5b40a8e","db_id":263665,"person_id":227702},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vipu","last_name":"Arora","fullName":"Arora, Vipu","id":"263666","affiliation":"IIT Kanpur and KU Leuven","emailHash":"1a88ef755ce8b92148a02c9f7ad7d1f0","db_id":263666,"person_id":227701}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"176","db_id":137846,"friendly_id":176,"title":"Multigrid low-mode averaging for Wilson fermions","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We develop a generalization of low-mode averaging in which the number of low quark modes of the Dirac operator required for a constant variance reduction can be kept independent of the volume by exploiting their local coherence. Typically in lattice QCD simulations, the benefit of translation averaging quark propagators over the space-time volume is spoiled by large fluctuations introduced by the approximations needed to estimate the average. For quark-line connected diagrams at large separations, most of this additional variance can be efficiently suppressed by the introduction of hierarchical subspaces, thanks to the reduced size of the coarse grid operators that act within the subspaces. In this work, we investigate the contributions to the variance of the isovector vector current correlator with $N_f=2$ non-perturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions on lattices approximately of size $L = 2, 3$ and $4$ fm. The numerical results obtained confirm that the variance decreases as the volume is increased when a multigrid decomposition is used with a fixed number of low modes. While the proposed decomposition can be applied to any quark propagator, it is expected to be especially effective for quark-line connected diagrams at large separations, for example, the isovector contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization or baryonic correlators.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137846\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Roman","last_name":"Gruber","fullName":"Gruber, Roman","id":"262243","affiliation":"","emailHash":"30ea97e8b7a8040987f41db9da222f63","db_id":262243,"person_id":225671}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marina","last_name":"Krstic Marinkovic","fullName":"Krstic Marinkovic, Marina","id":"262244","affiliation":"ETH Zurich","emailHash":"dae75e8edd5d8295dc8d55ba63c8b732","db_id":262244,"person_id":225673},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Roman","last_name":"Gruber","fullName":"Gruber, Roman","id":"262243","affiliation":"","emailHash":"30ea97e8b7a8040987f41db9da222f63","db_id":262243,"person_id":225671},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Harris","fullName":"Harris, Tim","id":"262245","affiliation":"","emailHash":"1c8748c6d281675870bc8c960bfc7026","db_id":262245,"person_id":225672}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"213","db_id":137843,"friendly_id":213,"title":"Analyzing the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model with the Worldvolume HMC method","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We apply the Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] to the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model, a system structurally similar to finite-density QCD.

This enables an exponential gain in the signal-to-noise of fermionic correlators as the number of submeasurements increases. We test the method on pure gauge ensembles and we compute both the first two terms in the series with a two-level sampling.

We also discuss the setup cost of multigrid and our architecture to give a fair comparison between the two.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137851\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Pfahler","fullName":"Pfahler, Simon","id":"262268","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","emailHash":"25356a49f14695165d0e97a213d789d5","db_id":262268,"person_id":220872}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christoph","last_name":"Lehner","fullName":"Lehner, Christoph","id":"262270","affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t Regensburg","emailHash":"ac5b600f1d51468939e6ffe0b985c084","db_id":262270,"person_id":220873},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Kn\u00fcttel","fullName":"Kn\u00fcttel, Daniel","id":"262267","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","emailHash":"391e1c9d56de9d053eef97d74068ae07","db_id":262267,"person_id":220871},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Pfahler","fullName":"Pfahler, Simon","id":"262268","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","emailHash":"25356a49f14695165d0e97a213d789d5","db_id":262268,"person_id":220872},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tilo","last_name":"Wettig","fullName":"Wettig, Tilo","id":"262269","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","emailHash":"fdf8c4069e12e9499fea84d0883a832a","db_id":262269,"person_id":220874}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"207","db_id":137849,"friendly_id":207,"title":"Multilevel Normalizing Flow Samplers with Built-in Variance Reduction in LFT","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Abstract:\r\nWe present a multilevel generative sampler for lattice field theories that combines local upsampling with normalizing flows (NFs).

Our results show that hierarchical generative sampling scales more efficiently than training single-level models directly at large lattice sizes. We further introduce a multilevel estimator that prioritizes sampling at the coarser scales, yielding significant variance reduction.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137849\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ankur","last_name":"Singha","fullName":"Singha, Ankur","id":"262264","affiliation":"Technical University Berlin","emailHash":"4eef909bd12c02af07d7c8f1ebb827e0","db_id":262264,"person_id":225747}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ankur","last_name":"Singha","fullName":"Singha, Ankur","id":"262264","affiliation":"Technical University Berlin","emailHash":"4eef909bd12c02af07d7c8f1ebb827e0","db_id":262264,"person_id":225747},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shinichi","last_name":"Nakajima","fullName":"Nakajima, Shinichi","id":"262260","affiliation":"Technical University Berlin","emailHash":"bc7616b7cd356f96552dc7821e4e6928","db_id":262260,"person_id":216874}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"K\u00fchn","fullName":"K\u00fchn, Stefan","id":"262261","affiliation":"DESY","emailHash":"b7b20b74dc6bc9fe65cd244e0d47814f","db_id":262261,"person_id":216879},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Karl","last_name":"Jansen","fullName":"Jansen, Karl","id":"262262","affiliation":"DESY","emailHash":"aeb7f0e1c93cc12f61b6a6a9b9226bbc","db_id":262262,"person_id":216877},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kim A.","last_name":"Nicoli","fullName":"Nicoli, Kim A.","id":"262263","affiliation":"","emailHash":"699b6fa18264dd775b04b39716bc7a12","db_id":262263,"person_id":216881}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"40","db_id":137847,"friendly_id":40,"title":"A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"In recent years, flow-based samplers have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional sampling methods in lattice gauge theory.

The training parameters of the model are optimised via gradients obtained from backpropagation of a convolutional neural network. Preliminary tests on SU(3) gauge ensembles demonstrate the potential of this approach to improve the efficiency of lattice gauge fixing.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137857\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ho","last_name":"Hsiao","fullName":"Hsiao, Ho","id":"262290","affiliation":"Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba","emailHash":"cdb9347a0857fb4d26987dcc4fc573ba","db_id":262290,"person_id":225022}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Akio","last_name":"Tomiya","fullName":"Tomiya, Akio","id":"262287","affiliation":"Tokyo Woman\u2019s Christian University","emailHash":"439dd37f654279fd3d8b050fb122318f","db_id":262287,"person_id":223576},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Benjamin Jaedon","last_name":"Choi","fullName":"Choi, Benjamin Jaedon","id":"262289","affiliation":"Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba","emailHash":"dfbce568ea70db4fcdb23c20874b1660","db_id":262289,"person_id":223578},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hiroshi","last_name":"Ohno","fullName":"Ohno, Hiroshi","id":"262288","affiliation":"Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba","emailHash":"c78d36c2b6aa4cb12338a379323833b5","db_id":262288,"person_id":223577},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ho","last_name":"Hsiao","fullName":"Hsiao, Ho","id":"262290","affiliation":"Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba","emailHash":"cdb9347a0857fb4d26987dcc4fc573ba","db_id":262290,"person_id":225022}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"53","db_id":137858,"friendly_id":53,"title":"Machine Learning-Based Estimation of Cumulants of Chiral Condensate via Multi-Ensemble Reweighting with Deborah.jl","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Investigating the critical endpoint of the finite-temperature QCD phase transition requires higher-order cumulants of the chiral condensate. These, in turn, involve traces of inverse Dirac operator powers $\\text{Tr}\\,M^{-n}$ ($n=1,2,3,4$). Because direct computation with the Conjugate Gradient method is computationally expensive, we adopted a machine-learning strategy using gradient-boosted decision tree regression with bias correction [1], trained on data from simulations with the Iwasaki gauge action and Wilson clover fermion action [2]. The labeled set was split into training and bias-correction subsets, and the trained model was applied to unlabeled data, with the resulting bias-corrected ML estimates then examined. Building on earlier progress [3], we further applied multi-ensemble reweighting and interpolation to estimate cumulants at the first-order phase transition point, investigating dependence on the fraction of labeled and training data. Using $\\text{Tr}\\,M^{-1}$ from original measurements both as a direct component of the cumulant calculation and as an input feature for training ML models to estimate $\\text{Tr}\\,M^{-n}$ ($n=2,3,4$), we found that even with only 1% labeled data, susceptibility, skewness, and kurtosis agreed almost perfectly with the original, suggesting that the computational cost can be reduced to approximately 25.8% of the original. To further probe avenues for reducing computational cost, we also incorporated the Plaquette and Rectangle loops as input features. Using these, we performed bias-corrected ML estimation for all four $\\text{Tr}\\,M^{-n}$ in a single workflow and then carried out multi-ensemble reweighting. Unlike our main methodology, where original $\\text{Tr}\\,M^{-1}$ is directly used and its statistical fluctuations naturally propagate through the analysis, this setup relies solely on correlations between the features and target. This also allowed us to investigate, in detail, the sensitivity of cumulant estimates to the presence or absence of bias correction.\r\n\r\n[1] B. Yoon et al., Phys. Rev.

In field theory, this method could be used to calculate false vacuum decay rates. The original probability distribution of the system is multiplied by a simple re-weighting function which guarantees that the system transitions between the meta-stable and stable regimes within a specified range of time. We then perform series of subset simulations with the re-weighting function gradually removed. By combining the results of these simulations, we get the change in the transition probability during the specified time range. Because the re-weighting function is known from the beginning, all simulations can be performed in parallel, or even combined into a single Monte Carlo simulation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137854\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Swaim","fullName":"Swaim, Joshua","id":"262280","affiliation":"University of Connecticut","emailHash":"517f5a1cc8d0c5eeb69ee3515a2c48e3","db_id":262280,"person_id":225844}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Swaim","fullName":"Swaim, Joshua","id":"262280","affiliation":"University of Connecticut","emailHash":"517f5a1cc8d0c5eeb69ee3515a2c48e3","db_id":262280,"person_id":225844},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Luchang","last_name":"Jin","fullName":"Jin, Luchang","id":"262281","affiliation":"University of Connecticut","emailHash":null,"db_id":262281,"person_id":225845}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"256","db_id":137852,"friendly_id":256,"title":"Normalizing Flows for the Density of States in Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory with a $\\theta$-term","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"A while ago, the generalised density-of-states method was proposed to address the sign problem that arises in systems with a complex action.

Both the Wilson and Brillouin Dirac operators are tested as kernels. As in any other rational approximation, the diagonal KL iterates of order (n,n) can be decomposed into partial fractions with n poles, which are inverted using a multi-shift conjugate gradient solver. This representation requires no spectral information, simplifying the implementation. We compute the PCAC quark mass and pion mass and determine the critical bare mass for several n, confirming that the additive mass shift and the violation of the Ginsparg\u2013Wilson relation decrease monotonically with n. We also compare the Wilson and Brillouin kernels and find favorable performance for the latter in terms of CPU time.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137866\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stylianos","last_name":"Gregoriou","fullName":"Gregoriou, Stylianos","id":"262321","affiliation":"The Cyprus Institute","emailHash":"b8b0ccab6ffd685aafd3737a6fdd2653","db_id":262321,"person_id":225682}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giannis","last_name":"Koutsou","fullName":"Koutsou, Giannis","id":"262319","affiliation":"The Cyprus Institutes","emailHash":"7f31748fc866ad2b0e760703ecf9df99","db_id":262319,"person_id":225681},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stephan","last_name":"Durr","fullName":"Durr, Stephan","id":"262320","affiliation":"University of Wuppertal","emailHash":"f8a21c0769b0ac0b58d7e957b05b5f4e","db_id":262320,"person_id":225680},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stylianos","last_name":"Gregoriou","fullName":"Gregoriou, Stylianos","id":"262321","affiliation":"The Cyprus Institute","emailHash":"b8b0ccab6ffd685aafd3737a6fdd2653","db_id":262321,"person_id":225682}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"140","db_id":137864,"friendly_id":140,"title":"A first study of strong isospin breaking effects in lattice QCD using truncated polynomials","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Computing derivatives of observables with respect to parameters of the theory is a powerful tool in lattice QCD, as it allows the study of physical effects not directly accessible in the original Monte Carlo simulation.

A large number of algebraic correlator analysis methods including (block) Prony (and equivalently (block) Lanczos) and the generalised eigenvalue problem (GEVP) can be reproduced as sub-optimal special cases of the THC method. Moreover, the THC method is robust against noise and requires comparably little human oversight. When applied to symmetric data, the obtained energy spectrum is guaranteed to be symmetric up to machine precision. It goes without saying that the signal-to-noise problem has not been solved.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137863\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":"262308","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"d0806cd7bfd9132da2a032fb9bf30d43","db_id":262308,"person_id":224540}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":"262308","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"d0806cd7bfd9132da2a032fb9bf30d43","db_id":262308,"person_id":224540}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carsten","last_name":"Urbach","fullName":"Urbach, Carsten","id":"262309","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"67263c5ac77e1342e7cdca171e9d5a95","db_id":262309,"person_id":224541}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"220","db_id":137868,"friendly_id":220,"title":"Towards a Renormalization-Group Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient for Domain Wall Fermions","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Recent advances such as multigrid and deflation have significantly accelerated Dirac operator solves in lattice QCD. However, the substantial setup costs of these methods have impeded their application in the repeated Dirac inversions required for HMC ensemble generation. Building on earlier work at Columbia University, which showed that renormalization-group (RG) blocked coarse lattices with $a^{-1} = 1$ GeV provide a good approximation of the low-mode structure of Mobius domain wall fermion (MDWF) Dirac operators on $a^{-1} = 2$ GeV lattices, we investigate how to exploit this correspondence in practice. Specifically, we study how filters and Wilson flow on the coarse lattices can be used to control the influence of higher modes in the coarse-fine mapping. Because RG blocking is computationally inexpensive, this approach could provide a way to incorporate multigrid-style acceleration directly into ensemble generation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137868\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"Eick","fullName":"Eick, Jonah","id":"262325","affiliation":"Columbia University","emailHash":"e7e965cfb8ceabafd8db329dcd6ca084","db_id":262325,"person_id":225783}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"Eick","fullName":"Eick, Jonah","id":"262325","affiliation":"Columbia University","emailHash":"e7e965cfb8ceabafd8db329dcd6ca084","db_id":262325,"person_id":225783}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"173","db_id":137865,"friendly_id":173,"title":"Configurational Thermometer for Lattice Gauge Theories.","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present a new temperature estimator for lattice gauge theories. This estimator is based on the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action. It draws inspiration from geometric methods in statistical mechanics. This approach provides a gauge-invariant and momentum-free way to check thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. Unlike traditional methods, which control temperature indirectly by adjusting lattice size or coupling, our estimator finds the effective temperature directly from field configurations. This allows for independent checks of thermalization and sampling accuracy. We apply the estimator to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions. We compare the measured temperatures with the input temperatures over a wide range of couplings and lattice sizes. The estimator reliably reproduces the target temperature and performs well against discretization effects and algorithmic artifacts. It can spot sampling issues, slow thermalization, or errors in implementation, making it a useful tool for large-scale simulations. We also discuss potential extensions to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and integration with hybrid Monte Carlo workflows.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137865\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vamika","last_name":"Longia","fullName":"Longia, Vamika","id":"262316","affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali","emailHash":"5cb8f60569657f89f7413f2e7fd13e80","db_id":262316,"person_id":225659}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anosh","last_name":"Joseph","fullName":"Joseph, Anosh","id":"262318","affiliation":"University of the Witwatersrand","emailHash":"888d6da58c8f7e698f05302bdae4e7ec","db_id":262318,"person_id":225660},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Navdeep","last_name":"Dhindsa","fullName":"Dhindsa, Navdeep","id":"262317","affiliation":"","emailHash":"245b7f19ec0221503162b8c60242f610","db_id":262317,"person_id":223574},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vamika","last_name":"Longia","fullName":"Longia, Vamika","id":"262316","affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali","emailHash":"5cb8f60569657f89f7413f2e7fd13e80","db_id":262316,"person_id":225659}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"186","db_id":137867,"friendly_id":186,"title":"Bootstrap-determined $p$-values in lattice QCD","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present a method based on the bootstrap to determine $p$-values from Monte Carlo data, in particular those generated in a lattice QCD calculation, where we make no assumptions about the underlying distribution.

Recent advances in generative modeling, including diffusion models, offer accelerated approaches for sampling complicated probability distributions. In this work, we present a diffusion-based framework for sampling ${\\rm SU}(N)$ degrees of freedom. We adapt the traditional score matching technique for training diffusion models to the ${\\rm SU}(N)$ group manifold and demonstrate that our models faithfully reproduce both the heat kernel evolution as well as a family of target densities for toy theories. By solving the reverse-time ODE directly on the group, we can efficiently generate unbiased ${\\rm SU}(2)$ estimates from single-site toy models. These results mark a step for diffusion models towards modeling full ${\\rm SU}(N)$ lattice field theories and, ultimately, ${\\rm SU}(N)$ gauge theory on the lattice.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137871\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Octavio","last_name":"Vega","fullName":"Vega, Octavio","id":"262332","affiliation":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","emailHash":"7deb202dea38f7467965c16dfa5af6a9","db_id":262332,"person_id":225850}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Octavio","last_name":"Vega","fullName":"Vega, Octavio","id":"262332","affiliation":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","emailHash":"7deb202dea38f7467965c16dfa5af6a9","db_id":262332,"person_id":225850}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gurtej","last_name":"Kanwar","fullName":"Kanwar, Gurtej","id":"262333","affiliation":"University of Edinburgh","emailHash":"ee005ab7939ab00f8090473f6574abf4","db_id":262333,"person_id":221159}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"201","db_id":137870,"friendly_id":201,"title":"Sampling from a complex distribution using an Energy-based Diffusion model","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Complex langevin for theories with a sign problem effectively sample from a real-valued probability distribution that is a priori unknown and notoriously hard to predict.

Here, on the one side, most traditional Monte Carlo methods suffer from critical slowing down. On the other side, generative models find it increasingly difficult to learn the map from a simpler to the targeted theory.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this problem, we construct a generative model using the physics-informed renormalisation group. Here, the layered map is trained and optimised independently on each layer. For each layer, the training boils down to solving an independent linear differential equation. This potentially parallelises the training procedure. Moreover, because the differential equation is analytically given, it allows for a systematic error correction and improvement beyond training time. This is done without requiring samples from the targeted theory. These features pave the way for future research and enable a systematic correction and design of generative models for lattice field theories. We illustrate the practical feasibility of the architecture within simulations of scalar field theories.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137872\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Renzo","last_name":"Kapust","fullName":"Kapust, Renzo","id":"262334","affiliation":"Institute for theoretical Physics, University of Heidelberg","emailHash":"28b38036128688a44bebbf68c7bf764f","db_id":262334,"person_id":225722}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Friederike","last_name":"Ihssen","fullName":"Ihssen, Friederike","id":"262336","affiliation":"Institute for theoretical Physics, University of Heidelberg","emailHash":null,"db_id":262336,"person_id":225724},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jan M.","last_name":"Pawlowski","fullName":"Pawlowski, Jan M.","id":"262335","affiliation":"Institute for theoretical physics, University of Heidelberg","emailHash":null,"db_id":262335,"person_id":225723},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Renzo","last_name":"Kapust","fullName":"Kapust, Renzo","id":"262334","affiliation":"Institute for theoretical Physics, University of Heidelberg","emailHash":"28b38036128688a44bebbf68c7bf764f","db_id":262334,"person_id":225722}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Ostmeyer","firstName":"Johann","name":"Ostmeyer, Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","first_name":"Johann","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Bonn","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":224540,"db_id":12726,"person_id":224540,"emailHash":"d0806cd7bfd9132da2a032fb9bf30d43"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Barca","firstName":"Lorenzo","name":"Barca, Lorenzo","last_name":"Barca","first_name":"Lorenzo","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"DESY","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Barca, Lorenzo","id":225310,"db_id":12724,"person_id":225310,"emailHash":"74b715eb6973e08d9740b266a6f03be3"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Singh","firstName":"Simran","name":"Singh, Simran","last_name":"Singh","first_name":"Simran","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"HISKP, University of Bonn","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Singh, Simran","id":225491,"db_id":12725,"person_id":225491,"emailHash":"7fe3187f5f62f6a93712c785f6361474"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Gruber","firstName":"Roman","name":"Gruber, Roman","last_name":"Gruber","first_name":"Roman","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Gruber, Roman","id":225671,"db_id":12728,"person_id":225671,"emailHash":"30ea97e8b7a8040987f41db9da222f63"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Namekawa","firstName":"Yusuke","name":"Namekawa, Yusuke","last_name":"Namekawa","first_name":"Yusuke","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Fukuyama University","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Namekawa, Yusuke","id":225760,"db_id":12727,"person_id":225760,"emailHash":"5c4e4fff9ed1662156ecf00c28cb9105"}],"title":"Algorithms and artificial intelligence","color":"#5f171a","textColor":"#ffffff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20932\/","roomFullname":"","location":"","address":"","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":7,"id":"13","db_id":20932,"friendly_id":13,"room":"","code":""},"room":"AG69","roomFullname":"AG69","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Gruber","firstName":"Roman","name":"Gruber, Roman","last_name":"Gruber","first_name":"Roman","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Gruber, Roman","id":225671,"db_id":12728,"person_id":225671,"emailHash":"30ea97e8b7a8040987f41db9da222f63"}],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":25165,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

To address this challenge, we present a Hamiltonian-based variational approach for numerical simulations of quantum mechanical systems. We benchmark our method on two physical models of interest\u2014*2+1D* compact lattice QED with Wilson fermion discretization, and the minimal BMN matrix model.\r\n\r\nWe employ a variational Monte Carlo algorithm, where we construct a parameterized ansatz state and approximate the ground state by minimizing the energy w.r.t. the variational parameters. The ansatz is decomposed into two parts\u2014a gauge\/bosonic part and a fermionic part, each constructed using gauge invariant combinations of the underlying degrees of freedom. For the gauge\/bosonic part of the ansatz, we work in a continuous basis of the physical Hilbert space to avoid basis truncations (such as cutoffs in electric flux or bosonic occupation numbers, which are introduced to make the infinite-dimensional degrees of freedom numerically tractable). The expectation values are computed in this continuous basis by numerical integration using Monte Carlo. To avoid the fermionic sign problem we approximate the fermionic part of the ansatz as a fermionic gaussian state for each gauge\/bosonic field configuration. As a result, the expectation value w.r.t. to fermionic state is computed analytically, removing the need for sampling from fermionic distributions. \r\n\r\nWe show preliminary results for the ground state preparation in the sign problem afflicted regimes of the *2+1D* compact lattice QED and the BMN matrix model, demonstrating the viability of this Hamiltonian variational approach and offers a path towards studying regimes inaccessible to Euclidean Monte Carlo.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137861\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pranay","last_name":"Naredi","fullName":"Naredi,

We construct both the continuum and lattice versions of the 2D MSYM theory. The lattice action preserves a subset of supersymmetries. We extend the existing lattice codes with new routines to accommodate the additional terms in the lower-dimensional theory. This lattice construction enables us to perform Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of 2D MSYM and facilitates the exploration of its continuum limit. Our work contributes to the numerical study of maximally supersymmetric gauge theories and supports the ongoing efforts to test gauge-gravity duality and investigate related non-perturbative phenomena.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137740\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"BANA","last_name":"SINGH","fullName":"SINGH, BANA","id":"261828","affiliation":"","emailHash":"b114471a1d7e5625703b78c5445817cf","db_id":261828,"person_id":225867}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"BANA","last_name":"SINGH","fullName":"SINGH, BANA","id":"261828","affiliation":"","emailHash":"b114471a1d7e5625703b78c5445817cf","db_id":261828,"person_id":225867}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anosh","last_name":"Joseph","fullName":"Joseph, Anosh","id":"261827","affiliation":"University of the Witwatersrand","emailHash":"888d6da58c8f7e698f05302bdae4e7ec","db_id":261827,"person_id":225660},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"David","last_name":"Schaich","fullName":"Schaich, David","id":"261829","affiliation":"","emailHash":"614fb01cb0b7d9ba8a2922c8c1db3c41","db_id":261829,"person_id":225858}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Sen","firstName":"Srimoyee","name":"Sen, Srimoyee","last_name":"Sen","first_name":"Srimoyee","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Sen, Srimoyee","id":217200,"db_id":12746,"person_id":217200,"emailHash":"ccafe2adcda2c4b929bc0bbc6ed19877"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Dhindsa","firstName":"Navdeep","name":"Dhindsa, Navdeep","last_name":"Dhindsa","first_name":"Navdeep","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Dhindsa, Navdeep","id":223574,"db_id":12747,"person_id":223574,"emailHash":"245b7f19ec0221503162b8c60242f610"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Fukaya","firstName":"Hidenori","name":"Fukaya, Hidenori","last_name":"Fukaya","first_name":"Hidenori","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"The University of Osaka","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Fukaya, Hidenori","id":224651,"db_id":12745,"person_id":224651,"emailHash":"7f79ff25b353168650bfb1903513be66"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Joseph","firstName":"Anosh","name":"Joseph, Anosh","last_name":"Joseph","first_name":"Anosh","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of the Witwatersrand","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Joseph, Anosh","id":225660,"db_id":12736,"person_id":225660,"emailHash":"888d6da58c8f7e698f05302bdae4e7ec"}],"title":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","color":"#dfdfdf","textColor":"#151515","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20941\/","roomFullname":"HBA1","location":"HBA1","address":"","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":8,"id":"22","db_id":20941,"friendly_id":22,"room":"HBA1","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24737,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Similarities to staggered fermions exist, namely, spin and taste degrees of freedom become intertwined, and a peculiar nonsinglet chiral symmetry and ultralocality are maintained. However, charge conjugation, some space-time reflection symmetries and isotropy are broken by the cutoff. \r\nWe address the most simple variant, Karsten-Wilczek fermions, and derive the correct spin-taste representation from first principles. The spin-taste representation on the quark level permits construction of local or extended hadron interpolating operators for any spin-taste combination, albeit with contamination by parity partners and taste-symmetry breaking. We classify hadron interpolating operators and the Noether currents. We also discuss appropriate discretizations for taste-singlet or -isovector mass or chemical potential terms. \r\nWe explain the counterterms in this spin-taste framework, and derive generic constraints on the parametric form and cutoff effects from the KW determinant and hadronic correlation functions. We derive how and why nonperturbative tuning schemes for the counterterms work, and obtain analytic, assumption-free, nonperturbative predictions for taste-symmetry breaking and other hadronic properties from first principles. In particular, we identify the origin and nature of two different types of taste-symmetry breaking cutoff effects. The few available numerical results for KW fermions validate these predictions.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137746\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johannes Heinrich","last_name":"Weber","fullName":"Weber, Johannes Heinrich","id":"261855","affiliation":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt","emailHash":"3fa20597698298c788756152db78fa6b","db_id":261855,"person_id":224808}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johannes Heinrich","last_name":"Weber","fullName":"Weber, Johannes Heinrich","id":"261855","affiliation":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt","emailHash":"3fa20597698298c788756152db78fa6b","db_id":261855,"person_id":224808}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"154","db_id":137743,"friendly_id":154,"title":"How to formulate the $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ topological invariant of Majorana fermion on the lattice","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Topological invariants and their associated anomalies have played a crucial role in understanding low-energy phenomena in quantum field theories. In lattice gauge theory, the standard $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued Atiyah\u2013Singer index is formulated via the overlap Dirac operator through the Ginsparg\u2013Wilson relation, but extensions to more general topological invariants have remained limited. In this work, we propose a lattice formulation of the Arf\u2013Brown\u2013Kervaire (ABK) invariant, which takes values in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$. The ABK invariant arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional unoriented manifolds, and its definition involves an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that must be properly regularized. By carefully treating the boundary conditions, with and without a domain-wall mass term, we demonstrate that the ABK invariant can be extracted from Pfaffians of the Wilson Dirac operator. We further provide numerical verification on two-dimensional lattices, showing that the $\\mathbb{Z}_8$-valued results on the torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane, and M\u00f6bius strip agree with those in the continuum theory.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137743\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sho","last_name":"Araki","fullName":"Araki, Sho","id":"261846","affiliation":"The University of Osaka","emailHash":"508215f6290e8b15b85faf5d22c7f3e5","db_id":261846,"person_id":225563}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sho","last_name":"Araki","fullName":"Araki, Sho","id":"261846","affiliation":"The University of Osaka","emailHash":"508215f6290e8b15b85faf5d22c7f3e5","db_id":261846,"person_id":225563}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hidenori","last_name":"Fukaya","fullName":"Fukaya, Hidenori","id":"261847","affiliation":"The University of Osaka","emailHash":"7f79ff25b353168650bfb1903513be66","db_id":261847,"person_id":224651},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Satoshi","last_name":"Yamaguchi","fullName":"Yamaguchi, Satoshi","id":"261849","affiliation":"U.

The $L_s\\to\\infty$ extrapolation of the bilinear condensate $\\langle\\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle$ as a function of coupling and bare mass is fitted to an empirical equation of state; the resulting critical exponents are significantly altered from previously obtained values, and for the first time resemble those emerging from analytic predictions based on approximate solutions to Schwinger-Dyson equations, consistent with a putative UV-stable renormalisation fixed point. To address the non-perturbative issue of the value $N_c$ below which such a fixed point exists we present preliminary results obtained with $N=2$.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137749\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Hands","fullName":"Hands, Simon","id":"261863","affiliation":"University of Liverpool","emailHash":"de7d4edf269325d801ab419885e15bce","db_id":261863,"person_id":225554}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Hands","fullName":"Hands, Simon","id":"261863","affiliation":"University of Liverpool","emailHash":"de7d4edf269325d801ab419885e15bce","db_id":261863,"person_id":225554}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jude","last_name":"Worthy","fullName":"Worthy, Jude","id":"261864","affiliation":"Swansea University","emailHash":"a36d5b44c9bac9d9f0b2121ce924b8aa","db_id":261864,"person_id":225555}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"114","db_id":137748,"friendly_id":114,"title":"Thermal SU(2) gauge theory for the pseudogap and origin of cuprate superconductivity","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Cuprate superconductors, the most commonly known class of high-$T_c$ superconductors, have much richer properties than the conventional superconductors, yet much of it is not well-understood. To explain their physical origin, many theories involving emergent gauge fields have been put forth in recent years. Focusing on the theory developed in Christos et al., PNAS 120(21) e2302701120 (2023),  consisting of fundamental SU(2) bosons of charge $e$ coupled to emergent SU(2) gauge fields, we develop a Monte-Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample the fluctuating gauge and boson fields in presence of finite temperature. We demonstrate a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the superconducting (SC) to a pseudo-gap (PG) phase and the existence of vortices with flux $h\/(2e)$ confirming that indeed these arise due to confinement of the SU(2) gauge fields. Furthermore, we explicitly show the  existence of a period-4 charge order nucleating inside the vortex cores, observed in the experiments by Hoffman et al., Science 295, 466 (2002). Further, we also observe Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral density in the high temperature PG phase where quantum oscillations of hole pockets with fractional area in the local electron density of states are also observed, thus unifying these seemingly unrelated phenomena within the framework of a single theory.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137748\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Harshit","last_name":"Pandey","fullName":"Pandey, Harshit","id":"261862","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai","emailHash":"9b126cab9dad472e67c6ee1cf06b6b43","db_id":261862,"person_id":220680}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Harshit","last_name":"Pandey","fullName":"Pandey, Harshit","id":"261862","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai","emailHash":"9b126cab9dad472e67c6ee1cf06b6b43","db_id":261862,"person_id":220680}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"148","db_id":137747,"friendly_id":148,"title":"Eigenstate Thermalization in 1+1-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled with Dynamical Fermions","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Understanding thermalization in isolated non-Abelian gauge theories is a key challenge for quantum simulation.

The scheme is started by representing the system as a tensor network and coarse-graining it with the higher-order tensor renormalization group algorithm. Thereafter, we construct the corresponding numerical transfer matrix from the coarse-grained tensor and evaluate its eigenvalues to extract the energy spectrum. Following this, we classify the quantum number of the energy eigenstates by computing the matrix elements of a proper insertion operator. The matrix elements are represented as impurity tensor networks and computed with the coarse-graining scheme. After the classification, we identify the number of particles in each eigenstate from the size dependence of the corresponding energy eigenvalues, and we can detect up to the four-particle state. From the two particle-state sectors, we analyze the dynamics by computing the scattering phase shift with two approaches i.e. first is from the energy spectrum with a help of L\u00fcscher\u2019s formula and second is from the two-particle state wave function.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137754\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fathiyya Izzatun Az","last_name":"Zahra","fullName":"Zahra, Fathiyya Izzatun Az","id":"261885","affiliation":"Kanazawa University","emailHash":"b4595a1bac7656ff3505156166cd5b5c","db_id":261885,"person_id":217135}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fathiyya Izzatun Az","last_name":"Zahra","fullName":"Zahra, Fathiyya Izzatun Az","id":"261885","affiliation":"Kanazawa University","emailHash":"b4595a1bac7656ff3505156166cd5b5c","db_id":261885,"person_id":217135}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shinji","last_name":"Takeda","fullName":"Takeda, Shinji","id":"261886","affiliation":"Kanazawa University","emailHash":"3b4b49b953a3a2353c983d5a1d1e449c","db_id":261886,"person_id":217134},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Takeshi","last_name":"Yamazaki","fullName":"Yamazaki, Takeshi","id":"261887","affiliation":"University of Tsukuba","emailHash":"93b9dc935f42187b211bb6db3053b729","db_id":261887,"person_id":217133}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"196","db_id":137753,"friendly_id":196,"title":"Analysis of  Finite Density 3d Complex Scalar Theory by MDTRG","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) is a promising numerical\r\nmethod for systems with the sign problem.

Owing to the hyperbolic nature of such graphs, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap, which is an external scale in the system, hindering the computation of critical exponents. Closing the spectral gap by adding a negative mass to the bare Laplacian is therefore essential to access a nontrivial fixed point, whose critical exponents are governed by the spectral dimension, which is three, corresponding to the Wilson\u2013Fisher universality class. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the nearest\u2010neighbor Ising model on  Bethe lattices, which has mean\u2010field critical exponents. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first explicit demonstration that a $\\phi^4$ theory and the discrete Ising model may flow to distinct fixed points on the same underlying lattice. We further comment on possible reasons for such deviations and propose future work to better understand critical phenomena on more general hyperbolic spaces.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137758\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Saswato","last_name":"Sen","fullName":"Sen, Saswato","id":"261897","affiliation":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","emailHash":"bb669be364406f0f27c8c4d4ff266e82","db_id":261897,"person_id":214433}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Saswato","last_name":"Sen","fullName":"Sen, Saswato","id":"261897","affiliation":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","emailHash":"bb669be364406f0f27c8c4d4ff266e82","db_id":261897,"person_id":214433}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"Delporte","fullName":"Delporte, Nicolas","id":"261894","affiliation":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":261894,"person_id":214434},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Reiko","last_name":"Toriumi","fullName":"Toriumi, Reiko","id":"261896","affiliation":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":261896,"person_id":214435},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rudrajit","last_name":"Banerjee","fullName":"Banerjee, Rudrajit","id":"261895","affiliation":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":261895,"person_id":214436}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"61","db_id":137759,"friendly_id":61,"title":"Finite-temperature Sp(4) Yang-Mills theory: towards the continuum","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present new results for Sp(4) Yang-Mills theory around its first-order thermal phase transition by reconstructing the density of states via the LLR algorithm.

A central challenge is the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor, which is complicated by nonlinear Ward identities constraining operator mixing and by large cutoff effects affecting the determination of renormalization constants. To address these issues, we employ a modified lattice action with shifted boundary conditions and define the coupling through the gradient flow at vanishing topological charge. Within this framework, we present preliminary results for the non-singlet sector, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. These results provide a basis for comparing different strategies to determine renormalization constants, a direction we plan to pursue in future work.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137757\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mika","last_name":"Lauk","fullName":"Lauk, Mika","id":"261892","affiliation":"HU-Berlin","emailHash":"0abfe02525411059a0fffd9cfd031243","db_id":261892,"person_id":219908}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Agostino","last_name":"Patella","fullName":"Patella, Agostino","id":"261893","affiliation":"HU-Berlin","emailHash":"e42877a040afdc8bc903a0b2afd32782","db_id":261893,"person_id":219909},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mika","last_name":"Lauk","fullName":"Lauk, Mika","id":"261892","affiliation":"HU-Berlin","emailHash":"0abfe02525411059a0fffd9cfd031243","db_id":261892,"person_id":219908}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Sen","firstName":"Srimoyee","name":"Sen, Srimoyee","last_name":"Sen","first_name":"Srimoyee","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Sen, Srimoyee","id":217200,"db_id":12746,"person_id":217200,"emailHash":"ccafe2adcda2c4b929bc0bbc6ed19877"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Dhindsa","firstName":"Navdeep","name":"Dhindsa, Navdeep","last_name":"Dhindsa","first_name":"Navdeep","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Dhindsa, Navdeep","id":223574,"db_id":12747,"person_id":223574,"emailHash":"245b7f19ec0221503162b8c60242f610"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Fukaya","firstName":"Hidenori","name":"Fukaya, Hidenori","last_name":"Fukaya","first_name":"Hidenori","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"The University of Osaka","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Fukaya, Hidenori","id":224651,"db_id":12745,"person_id":224651,"emailHash":"7f79ff25b353168650bfb1903513be66"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Joseph","firstName":"Anosh","name":"Joseph, Anosh","last_name":"Joseph","first_name":"Anosh","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of the Witwatersrand","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Joseph, Anosh","id":225660,"db_id":12736,"person_id":225660,"emailHash":"888d6da58c8f7e698f05302bdae4e7ec"}],"title":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","color":"#dfdfdf","textColor":"#151515","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20941\/","roomFullname":"HBA1","location":"HBA1","address":"","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":8,"id":"22","db_id":20941,"friendly_id":22,"room":"HBA1","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24773,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

We show that for a boundary theory that contains QCD, the exact U (1) symmetry in conjunction with fermion zeromodes in the 5d bulk gives rise to a 4d world with neither a strong CP problem nor a light \u03b7\u2032 meson. This solution to the strong CP problem results because the fermion zeromodes in the bulk which quench contributions to the partition function from nontrivial gauge field topology much in the way a massless up quark would, but without altering the hadron spectrum.

We also demonstrate that a meron cluster algorithm for the problem naturally samples the ground states of the Hamiltonian in the aforementioned Gauss Law sector.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137762\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"PALLABI","last_name":"DEY","fullName":"DEY, PALLABI","id":"261910","affiliation":"SAHA INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS","emailHash":"9ea079716a18c39036202fe832606278","db_id":261910,"person_id":224690}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"PALLABI","last_name":"DEY","fullName":"DEY, PALLABI","id":"261910","affiliation":"SAHA INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS","emailHash":"9ea079716a18c39036202fe832606278","db_id":261910,"person_id":224690}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Debasish","last_name":"Banerjee","fullName":"Banerjee, Debasish","id":"261911","affiliation":"University of Southampton","emailHash":"2acd76230dfede0c440fc53c0d90f2dc","db_id":261911,"person_id":224691},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Emilie","last_name":"Huffman","fullName":"Huffman, Emilie","id":"261912","affiliation":"Wake Forest University","emailHash":"56a853e9f0338375493fe109c631f966","db_id":261912,"person_id":224689}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"51","db_id":137764,"friendly_id":51,"title":"A novel Hamiltonian formulation of $1+1$ dimensional $\\phi^4$ theory in Daubechies Wavelet Basis","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We employ the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to study field theories in the nonperturbative Hamiltonian framework.

These results demonstrate that our framework can recover the complete structure of free quantum field theory in real time, establishing a solid foundation for applications to interacting quantum field theories.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137765\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesco","last_name":"Scardino","fullName":"Scardino, Francesco","id":"261917","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"","emailHash":"e3d7124e196ffcf989fb16f7beee2592","db_id":261917,"person_id":225169}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesco","last_name":"Scardino","fullName":"Scardino, Francesco","id":"261917","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"","emailHash":"e3d7124e196ffcf989fb16f7beee2592","db_id":261917,"person_id":225169}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giacomo","last_name":"Gradenigo","fullName":"Gradenigo, Giacomo","id":"261918","affiliation":"Gran Sasso Science Institute","emailHash":"74f0a3abb1a13911663aee7b0f43d877","db_id":261918,"person_id":224836},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Martina","last_name":"Giachello","fullName":"Giachello, Martina","id":"261919","affiliation":"Gran Sasso Science Institute","emailHash":"d75989eab1894377fb4f5e7916c95e4f","db_id":261919,"person_id":224834}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Theoretical developments and applications beyond Standard Model","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"215","db_id":137767,"friendly_id":215,"title":"Discretization effects of gradient flows in QCD-like theories on the lattice","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium Annex","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Recent software advances now allow large-scale lattice studies of the Corrigan\u2013Ramond large-$N_c$ limit of Yang-Mills theory coupled with a two-index antisymmetric fermion, providing a path to SUSY Yang-Mills.

Our quadrature-based method integrates reparameterization, data smoothing, optimization techniques, and various approaches to regularizing ill-conditioned systems. Together, these elements enable consistency checks that enhance the reliability of the inversion process. Through a series of controlled tests on toy models, we demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the method in the presence of noise. Using mock data, we approximate spectral densities from Euclidean correlators, generating smoothed and stable results that accurately reproduce correlator behavior; particularly at large Euclidean times. We also briefly explore the application of this framework to actual lattice simulations. Finally, we discuss possible directions for extending this approach to a broader class of problems in Lattice QCD and theoretical physics, where the inverse Laplace transformation is typically ill-posed.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137766\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Demetrianos","last_name":"Gavriel","fullName":"Gavriel,

Our setup employs a total of 11 qubits: 10 qubits represent stagger fermions sites, which correspond to five spatial lattice sites and one ancillary qubit for determination of matrix element of a bilinear operator via Hadamad test.  The PDF is obtained as the Fourier transform of this bilinear operator, which is measured along the light-cone direction. This approach offers a key advantage over traditional Euclidean lattice calculations, which require various approximations such as the LaMET framework. Compared with classical methods, quantum computation offers the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity particularly at $x=0$ and $x=1$, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact. The real quantum computer and simulator results match well within the estimated statistical error, although the error remains sizable. Our study demonstrates that meaningful PDF extraction is feasible on current quantum devices by reducing the two-qubit gate depth from 5000 to 500. Future generations of quantum hardware will be capable of maintaining greater circuit depth and hold promise for achieving precise PDF calculations.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137830\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ghanashyam","last_name":"Meher","fullName":"Meher, Ghanashyam","id":"262192","affiliation":"National Taiwan University","emailHash":"5e4d2a8b2b4f1c0ddf3bdbc623ccd7a2","db_id":262192,"person_id":219825}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ghanashyam","last_name":"Meher","fullName":"Meher, Ghanashyam","id":"262192","affiliation":"National Taiwan University","emailHash":"5e4d2a8b2b4f1c0ddf3bdbc623ccd7a2","db_id":262192,"person_id":219825},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiunn-Wei","last_name":"Chen","fullName":"Chen, Jiunn-Wei","id":"262194","affiliation":"National Taiwan University","emailHash":null,"db_id":262194,"person_id":219826},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yu-Ting","last_name":"Chen","fullName":"Chen, Yu-Ting","id":"262193","affiliation":"National Taiwan University","emailHash":null,"db_id":262193,"person_id":219827}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"247","db_id":137828,"friendly_id":247,"title":"Spectrum Generating Algebra in Higher Dimensional Gauge Theories","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":null,"description":"The existence of an approximate spectrum-generating algebra in the PXP model has been extensively studied as a mechanism underlying quantum many-body scars.

Using tensor network calculations, we investigate the dynamics of entanglement entropy when physical observables are measured at varying rates. We further demonstrate that the interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements gives rise to distinct behaviours in the weak and strong coupling regimes. Specifically, we show that for a fixed measurement rate, the late-time entanglement entropy saturates to different, characteristic values in each regime. These findings reveal signatures of measurement-induced effects and provide crucial insights for benchmarking and interpreting results from near-term quantum simulators.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137831\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nisa","last_name":"Ara","fullName":"Ara, Nisa","id":"262195","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai","emailHash":"8f1934560ac39e60c04f8dc908795538","db_id":262195,"person_id":225710}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nisa","last_name":"Ara","fullName":"Ara, Nisa","id":"262195","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai","emailHash":"8f1934560ac39e60c04f8dc908795538","db_id":262195,"person_id":225710}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arpan","last_name":"Bhattacharyya","fullName":"Bhattacharyya, Arpan","id":"262198","affiliation":"IIT, Gandhinagar","emailHash":null,"db_id":262198,"person_id":225708},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Indrakshi","last_name":"Raychowdhury","fullName":"Raychowdhury, Indrakshi","id":"262197","affiliation":"Department of Physics, BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":null,"db_id":262197,"person_id":219633},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Neha","last_name":"Nirbhan","fullName":"Nirbhan, Neha","id":"262196","affiliation":"IIT, Gandhinagar","emailHash":null,"db_id":262196,"person_id":225709},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nilachal","last_name":"Chakrabarti","fullName":"Chakrabarti, Nilachal","id":"262199","affiliation":"IIT, Gandhinagar","emailHash":null,"db_id":262199,"person_id":225711}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"252","db_id":137829,"friendly_id":252,"title":"Hilbert Space Fragmentation and Gauge Symmetry","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Lattice Hamiltonians with gauge symmetry are characterized by a local symmetry transformation per lattice site and may even exhibit further higher-form symmetries. There are then an exponentially large number of dynamically disconnected symmetry sectors, most of which are not translation-invariant. This results in localized dynamics even without the presence of disorder. An exponential number of dynamically disconnected sectors can also occur in systems that have no such symmetries, and this unexplained phenomenon is known as fragmentation. In this talk, I will discuss the parallels between the dynamics of systems with gauge symmetry and those that are fragmented. Additionally, I will discuss an emergent gauge symmetry, which is valid in a subset of sectors of the $S=1$ dipole-conserving spin chain, in an attempt to explain this model's fragmentation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137829\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Thea","last_name":"Budde","fullName":"Budde, Thea","id":"262190","affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","emailHash":"4a01fdbfecbf28f513363ccaef9e2206","db_id":262190,"person_id":225861}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joao C.","last_name":"Pinto Barros","fullName":"Pinto Barros, Joao C.","id":"262191","affiliation":"Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zurich","emailHash":"1b2b2c790fd9b54bf141adee4a255767","db_id":262191,"person_id":225863},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marina","last_name":"Krstic Marinkovic","fullName":"Krstic Marinkovic, Marina","id":"262189","affiliation":"ETH Zurich","emailHash":"dae75e8edd5d8295dc8d55ba63c8b732","db_id":262189,"person_id":225673},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Thea","last_name":"Budde","fullName":"Budde, Thea","id":"262190","affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","emailHash":"4a01fdbfecbf28f513363ccaef9e2206","db_id":262190,"person_id":225861}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Chakraborty","firstName":"Bipasha","name":"Chakraborty, Bipasha","last_name":"Chakraborty","first_name":"Bipasha","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Southampton","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Chakraborty, Bipasha","id":219636,"db_id":12718,"person_id":219636,"emailHash":"9c9624b9f2b0774bc116bc43df5603b6"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Huffman","firstName":"Emilie","name":"Huffman, Emilie","last_name":"Huffman","first_name":"Emilie","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Wake Forest University","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Huffman, Emilie","id":224689,"db_id":12711,"person_id":224689,"emailHash":"56a853e9f0338375493fe109c631f966"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Mendicelli","firstName":"Emanuele","name":"Mendicelli, Emanuele","last_name":"Mendicelli","first_name":"Emanuele","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Liverpool (United Kingdom)","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Mendicelli, Emanuele","id":225827,"db_id":12719,"person_id":225827,"emailHash":"e4939fb5a5557e589497fb63d1d31748"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Patel","firstName":"Apoorva","name":"Patel, Apoorva","last_name":"Patel","first_name":"Apoorva","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Patel, Apoorva","id":227671,"db_id":12710,"person_id":227671,"emailHash":"a88ed9f3b362146456d615e0a486c84c"}],"title":"Quantum computing and quantum information","color":"#b9cbca","textColor":"#0f0202","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20935\/","roomFullname":"AG80","location":"AG80","address":"","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":4,"id":"16","db_id":20935,"friendly_id":16,"room":"AG80","code":""},"room":"AG80","roomFullname":"AG80","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Huffman","firstName":"Emilie","name":"Huffman, Emilie","last_name":"Huffman","first_name":"Emilie","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Wake Forest University","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Huffman, Emilie","id":224689,"db_id":12711,"person_id":224689,"emailHash":"56a853e9f0338375493fe109c631f966"}],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24778,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

However, its effectiveness relies not only on accessing ground-state energies but also on preparing accurate eigenvectors, and the later is particularly challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We investigate this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one, two, and three dimensions, employing up to 27 qubits. We adopt two ansatzes - the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit. We benchmark them using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization. We find that while entanglement entropy is well reproduced in 1D, higher-dimensional systems demand deeper circuits and longer optimization. EfficientSU2 provides smoother optimization and performs well in low-entanglement regimes but underestimates critical correlations. In contrast, HVA circuits capture the entangled ground-state structure near criticality, though with more rugged optimization landscapes. We further show that VQE offers complementary insights into entanglement scaling in 3D TFIM by directly accessing the reduced density matrix and von Neumann entropy\u2014an advantage over Quantum Monte Carlo methods, which are limited to R\u00e9nyi entropy. These results demonstrate practical benchmarks for ansatz-design as well as highlight entanglement and correlation measures as diagnostics for reliable variational simulations of lattice models.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137834\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ashutosh","last_name":"Tripathi","fullName":"Tripathi, Ashutosh","id":"262212","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai","emailHash":"de29b51418c7a58b0038ed1f2daea7b4","db_id":262212,"person_id":224832}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ashutosh","last_name":"Tripathi","fullName":"Tripathi, Ashutosh","id":"262212","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai","emailHash":"de29b51418c7a58b0038ed1f2daea7b4","db_id":262212,"person_id":224832}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nilmani","last_name":"Mathur","fullName":"Mathur, Nilmani","id":"262211","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai","emailHash":"f5802162f14efc63e1e21cc9c2044ecb","db_id":262211,"person_id":207920},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vikram","last_name":"Tripathi","fullName":"Tripathi, Vikram","id":"262213","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai","emailHash":"70242f949566049a8a1c713536c021a9","db_id":262213,"person_id":224833}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"13","db_id":137836,"friendly_id":13,"title":"Computing quantum entanglement with machine learning","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Entanglement calculations in quantum field theories are extremely challenging and typically rely on the replica trick, where the problem is rephrased in a study of defects.

We have implemented the HHL algorithm and evaluated its performance across systems of varying sparsity and recorded each class separately with sizes upto $N=1024$.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal bottleneck of HHL lies in Quantum Phase Estimation. To address this, we explored several approximation strategies: Suzuki\u2013Trotter decomposition, a truncated Taylor series expansion, block encoding with quantum signal processing, and adiabatic-inspired evolution. These modifications substantially reduce circuit complexity and improve fidelity compared to naive implementations. In particular, Taylor expansion and block encoding consistently outperformed Trotterisation for less sparse systems, while Trotterisation was found to be suited to sparse systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance was measured using fidelity and execution time. Results on quantum simulators demonstrated high-fidelity solutions for sparse systems, while with dense systems the growing circuit depth lowers fidelity. These implementations were further tested on IBM Quantum hardware, which confirmed feasibility but revealed substantial noise and runtime overheads. Our results highlight the importance of matrix structure and Hamiltonian simulation strategy in practical HHL implementations, offering guidance for scaling the algorithm on near-term quantum devices.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137835\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dhruv","last_name":"Sood","fullName":"Sood, Dhruv","id":"262215","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research","emailHash":"e1beb290ada4025f314497e5e337a06b","db_id":262215,"person_id":225884}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dhruv","last_name":"Sood","fullName":"Sood, Dhruv","id":"262215","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research","emailHash":"e1beb290ada4025f314497e5e337a06b","db_id":262215,"person_id":225884},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nilmani","last_name":"Mathur","fullName":"Mathur, Nilmani","id":"262214","affiliation":"","emailHash":"f5802162f14efc63e1e21cc9c2044ecb","db_id":262214,"person_id":207920},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vikram","last_name":"Tripathi","fullName":"Tripathi, Vikram","id":"262216","affiliation":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai","emailHash":"70242f949566049a8a1c713536c021a9","db_id":262216,"person_id":224833}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"231","db_id":137833,"friendly_id":231,"title":"Ground state energy of a two-dimensional pure Z2 lattice gauge theory via sample-based quantum Krylov diagonalization","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We study the ground state energy of a two-dimensional pure $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) on a triangular lattice by applying the sample-based quantum Krylov diagonalization.

We propose a protocol for an analog quantum simulation of this non-Abelian physics using cold atoms. Based on the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) framework, our approach maps the SU(3)-invariant dynamics of strings and hadrons onto an SU(3) ionic Fermi-Hubbard model with three fermionic species, realizable with alkaline-earth-like atoms trapped in an optical lattice. This protocol maintains all local constraints, including the on-site SU(3) and on-link Abelian Gauss laws. We will demonstrate the validity of this approach by comparing the energy spectrum of the analog system with that of the target SU(3) gauge theory at a specific coupling, showing excellent agreement. The proposed simulation is scalable, fully gauge-invariant, and implementable with near-term technology, offering a tangible pathway to experimentally investigate non-perturbative string dynamics.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137839\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Emil","last_name":"Mathew","fullName":"Mathew, Emil","id":"262229","affiliation":"BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":"a6b16a046f998a65f64ce2a1afce2c90","db_id":262229,"person_id":225716}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Emil","last_name":"Mathew","fullName":"Mathew, Emil","id":"262229","affiliation":"BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":"a6b16a046f998a65f64ce2a1afce2c90","db_id":262229,"person_id":225716},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Indrakshi","last_name":"Raychowdhury","fullName":"Raychowdhury, Indrakshi","id":"262227","affiliation":"Department of Physics, BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":null,"db_id":262227,"person_id":219633},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Madhumita","last_name":"Kabiraj","fullName":"Kabiraj, Madhumita","id":"262230","affiliation":"","emailHash":"ec863133d77a189dda47a33abb628a6a","db_id":262230,"person_id":225715},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Raka","last_name":"Dasgupta","fullName":"Dasgupta, Raka","id":"262228","affiliation":"","emailHash":"ec2c8c7d36112136bca2870a68868a6a","db_id":262228,"person_id":225714}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"273","db_id":137840,"friendly_id":273,"title":"Exponential Improvement in Quantum-Simulation Cost of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics using Product Formulas","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We discuss how a systematic partitioning of the terms in a lattice gauge theory Hamiltonian, with regard to electric-basis discretization, can be done so as to dramatically reduce the number of terms to be simulated in product-formula-based quantum simulation protocols (including Trotterization). Compared to another frequently cited proposal, this simple regrouping can immediately drop at least a factor of one billion from the gate cost of simulating magnetic interactions in the fault-tolerant regime. We estimate about 13 overall orders of magnitude reduction in overall gate cost when other aspects of the cost are taken into consideration. Our findings indicate the maximum potential for product-formula methods is not a settled matter and warrants continued investigation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137840\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Stryker","fullName":"Stryker, Jesse","id":"262231","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","emailHash":"4fdb043823fdd77d95f4b2e19626f6c5","db_id":262231,"person_id":225902}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Stryker","fullName":"Stryker, Jesse","id":"262231","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","emailHash":"4fdb043823fdd77d95f4b2e19626f6c5","db_id":262231,"person_id":225902},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zohreh","last_name":"Davoudi","fullName":"Davoudi, Zohreh","id":"262232","affiliation":"University of Maryland","emailHash":"bbbe9ee9df6169e5c950e6273eebb344","db_id":262232,"person_id":225767}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"72","db_id":137838,"friendly_id":72,"title":"Toward Efficient Trotter-Suzuki Schemes for Long-Time Quantum Dynamics","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"12:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems\u2014whether in real or imaginary time\u2014is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables and ground state properties. I will present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. I will demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg XXZ model, comparing their performance and presenting the newly discovered schemes. Finally, I will discuss ongoing efforts to extend this framework to even higher orders and apply the derived schemes to quantum hardware, pushing the boundaries of both theoretical advancements and practical quantum computing.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137838\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marko","last_name":"Male\u017ei\u010d","fullName":"Male\u017ei\u010d, Marko","id":"262225","affiliation":"University of Bonn \/ Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics","emailHash":"f8f6a71623293f781cd45e52e2551a0c","db_id":262225,"person_id":224661}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marko","last_name":"Male\u017ei\u010d","fullName":"Male\u017ei\u010d, Marko","id":"262225","affiliation":"University of Bonn \/ Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics","emailHash":"f8f6a71623293f781cd45e52e2551a0c","db_id":262225,"person_id":224661}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":"262226","affiliation":"University Bonn","emailHash":"c6888df74500eeb96af4cac5b0ef6593","db_id":262226,"person_id":224662}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"144","db_id":137841,"friendly_id":144,"title":"A Quantum Oracle for Constraint Preservation in SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory Simulations","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories like QCD requires an efficient encoding of physical degrees of freedom that respects gauge invariance. The Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation offers a promising path, significantly reducing the number of qubits required to represent the SU(3) invariant states in 1+1 dimensions compared to traditional approaches. While the LSH basis automatically satisfies the non-Abelian Gauss laws, remnant local constraints on flux numbers must still be upheld. During time evolution on noisy quantum hardware, errors can accumulate, taking the system out of the valid physical Hilbert space. To address this, we present the construction of a quantum oracle designed to check these local constraints on the qubit register. This talk will detail the LSH mapping for SU(3) and the design of the constraint-checking oracle. We will present a resource analysis, quantifying the costs in terms of qubit count, gate operations, and circuit depth, providing a crucial tool for error mitigation in future quantum simulations of QCD.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137841\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fran","last_name":"Ilcic","fullName":"Ilcic, Fran","id":"262235","affiliation":"BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":"6c254fe2f6b6fd66a5515b13bccf73f2","db_id":262235,"person_id":225537}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fran","last_name":"Ilcic","fullName":"Ilcic, Fran","id":"262235","affiliation":"BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":"6c254fe2f6b6fd66a5515b13bccf73f2","db_id":262235,"person_id":225537},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Himadri","last_name":"Mukherjee","fullName":"Mukherjee, Himadri","id":"262233","affiliation":"BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":"c1b69d15ef34589b7b397b75a4230566","db_id":262233,"person_id":225536},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Indrakshi","last_name":"Raychowdhury","fullName":"Raychowdhury, Indrakshi","id":"262234","affiliation":"Department of Physics, BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus","emailHash":null,"db_id":262234,"person_id":219633}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quantum computing and quantum information","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Chakraborty","firstName":"Bipasha","name":"Chakraborty, Bipasha","last_name":"Chakraborty","first_name":"Bipasha","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Southampton","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Chakraborty, Bipasha","id":219636,"db_id":12718,"person_id":219636,"emailHash":"9c9624b9f2b0774bc116bc43df5603b6"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Huffman","firstName":"Emilie","name":"Huffman, Emilie","last_name":"Huffman","first_name":"Emilie","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Wake Forest University","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Huffman, Emilie","id":224689,"db_id":12711,"person_id":224689,"emailHash":"56a853e9f0338375493fe109c631f966"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Mendicelli","firstName":"Emanuele","name":"Mendicelli, Emanuele","last_name":"Mendicelli","first_name":"Emanuele","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Liverpool (United Kingdom)","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Mendicelli, Emanuele","id":225827,"db_id":12719,"person_id":225827,"emailHash":"e4939fb5a5557e589497fb63d1d31748"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Patel","firstName":"Apoorva","name":"Patel, Apoorva","last_name":"Patel","first_name":"Apoorva","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Patel, Apoorva","id":227671,"db_id":12710,"person_id":227671,"emailHash":"a88ed9f3b362146456d615e0a486c84c"}],"title":"Quantum computing and quantum information","color":"#b9cbca","textColor":"#0f0202","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20935\/","roomFullname":"AG80","location":"AG80","address":"","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":4,"id":"16","db_id":20935,"friendly_id":16,"room":"AG80","code":""},"room":"AG80","roomFullname":"AG80","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Mendicelli","firstName":"Emanuele","name":"Mendicelli, Emanuele","last_name":"Mendicelli","first_name":"Emanuele","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Liverpool (United Kingdom)","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Mendicelli, Emanuele","id":225827,"db_id":12719,"person_id":225827,"emailHash":"e4939fb5a5557e589497fb63d1d31748"}],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24590,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Additionally, we present preliminary results of our ongoing calculation of the inclusive semi-leptonic $B$ mesons decay rates with focus on some important technical aspects of the calculation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138021\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"marco","last_name":"garofalo","fullName":"garofalo, marco","id":"262778","affiliation":"University of Bonn, HISKP","emailHash":"9cb3d430ebd58bb4aaa52a17f32f00b8","db_id":262778,"person_id":225630}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"marco","last_name":"garofalo","fullName":"garofalo, marco","id":"262778","affiliation":"University of Bonn, HISKP","emailHash":"9cb3d430ebd58bb4aaa52a17f32f00b8","db_id":262778,"person_id":225630}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quark and lepton flavor physics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"12","db_id":138025,"friendly_id":12,"title":"Study of the  \u039b \u2192 p \u2113 \u03bd \u02c9  semileptonic decay in lattice QCD","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"12:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present the first lattice QCD determination of the \u039b\u2192N vector and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the semileptonic decay \u039b\u2192p\u2113\u03bd\u02c9. This channel provides a clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element \u2223Vus\u2223 from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible non-standard scalar and tensor interactions.

We find that the common phenomenological approximation of neglecting the q^2-dependence of the form factors leads to a \u223c4% deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.

In this talk, we investigate the main sources of systematic uncertainty in these decays, including the impact of Jacobi smearing at the source and sink, variations in source\u2013sink separation, and the intrinsic uncertainties of the inclusive reconstruction method itself. To investigate the latter, we restrict the reconstruction of the inclusive decay rate to just the excited-state contributions. We achieve this by treating the ground-state contributions as an exclusive decay with well-controlled conventional techniques. Systematic effects from the reconstruction then only affect excited-state contributions. Where these are sub-dominant, a suppression of systematic effects is expected. We show results based on Chebyshev reconstruction, which are part of a larger effort towards a first phenomenologically relevant computation of the inclusive decay rate in the continuum and infinite-volume limits.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138019\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ahmed","last_name":"Elgaziari","fullName":"Elgaziari, Ahmed","id":"262770","affiliation":"University of Southampton","emailHash":"43a0b5299026b0c561ee9cd458a6dcb8","db_id":262770,"person_id":225503}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ahmed","last_name":"Elgaziari","fullName":"Elgaziari, Ahmed","id":"262770","affiliation":"University of Southampton","emailHash":"43a0b5299026b0c561ee9cd458a6dcb8","db_id":262770,"person_id":225503}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Barone","fullName":"Barone, Alessandro","id":"262776","affiliation":"Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz","emailHash":"e1ac90acaa26e56f17090553ea5d622a","db_id":262776,"person_id":225500},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Juttner","fullName":"Juttner, Andreas","id":"262772","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"66525bcf521ec98cbb59f157c3899e2a","db_id":262772,"person_id":225506},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Kellermann","fullName":"Kellermann, Ryan","id":"262774","affiliation":"High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK)","emailHash":"50c2804b30d2c0ce94faa0f9bf9762cf","db_id":262774,"person_id":225504},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shoji","last_name":"Hashimoto","fullName":"Hashimoto, Shoji","id":"262775","affiliation":"KEK","emailHash":"9e10422cb46785c2ae54aa0cad456119","db_id":262775,"person_id":225505},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Takashi","last_name":"Kaneko","fullName":"Kaneko, Takashi","id":"262771","affiliation":"High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), School of High Energy Accelerator Science, SOKENDA","emailHash":"40c1f32cca90703c85a9d48f0a37d86a","db_id":262771,"person_id":225501},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zhi","last_name":"Hu","fullName":"Hu, Zhi","id":"262773","affiliation":"High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK)","emailHash":"c8e977a90f8a4757edfd49d7634ba8e6","db_id":262773,"person_id":225502}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quark and lepton flavor physics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"169","db_id":138037,"friendly_id":169,"title":"The smeared R-ratio in isoQCD from first-principles lattice simulations","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The R-ratio is a phenomenological observable of great relevance, both in itself and in applications such as the dispersive approach to the muon anomalous magnetic moment.

Renormalized quark masses are an important input to many phenomenological applications, including searching\/modeling physics beyond the Standard Model.  The non-perturbative renormalization is performed using gradient flow combined with the short-flow-time expansion that is improved by renormalization group (RG) running to match to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-scheme. RG running connects the lattice scale to higher energies thus improving the$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-scheme matching. Implementing the RG running perturbatively, we demonstrate this method works reliably at least up to the charm-quark mass and is not exhibiting any signs of the usual \"window problem\".\r\nUsing RBC\/UKQCD's (2+1)-flavor Shamir domain-wall fermion ensembles with Iwasaki gauge action, we find $m_s^{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}(\\mu=2\\text{ GeV}) = 89.1(3.2)$ MeV and $m_c^{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}(\\mu=3 \\text{ GeV}) = 973.4(8.3)$ MeV.

I will discuss the methodology, show initial results for the finite-volume spectrum and phase shift, and outline the path toward determining $B \\to K\\pi$ matrix elements in a fully dynamical framework.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138050\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Felix Benjamin","last_name":"Erben","fullName":"Erben, Felix Benjamin","id":"262924","affiliation":"","emailHash":"17f5d669aff7be892edf7c08ce613953","db_id":262924,"person_id":225773}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Felix Benjamin","last_name":"Erben","fullName":"Erben, Felix Benjamin","id":"262924","affiliation":"","emailHash":"17f5d669aff7be892edf7c08ce613953","db_id":262924,"person_id":225773}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quark and lepton flavor physics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"275","db_id":138053,"friendly_id":275,"title":"Kaon radiative leptonic decay rates from Twisted Mass simulations at the physical point","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present our recent calculation of radiative leptonic decay\r\nrates of the kaon, based on twisted clover simulations at the physical\r\npoint carried out by ETM collaboration.

This is particularly relevant given the persistent tensions with CKM unitarity observed when these elements are extracted from leptonic and semileptonic decays of light mesons, as well as from nuclear beta decays. A recent lattice QCD calculation by the ETM Collaboration of the inclusive hadronic $\\tau$ decay rate, performed in the isospin-symmetric limit using the HLT method to reconstruct the underlying spectral density, yields $|V_{us}| = 0.2189(7)_\\text{th}(18)_\\text{exp}$. This result is consistent with a determination based on the operator product expansion but reveals a $3\\sigma$ tension with CKM unitarity. To properly assess this discrepancy, it is essential to include electromagnetic and strong isospin-breaking corrections, which are currently neglected in the isospin-symmetric calculation. In this talk, I will present ongoing efforts and future prospects for computing these corrections using both the perturbative RM123 approach and fully dynamical QCD+QED simulations. I will also discuss how such corrections to the decay rate can be extracted from Euclidean lattice correlators through spectral reconstruction techniques, with proper treatment of the correlator renormalisation. The application of the HLT method to these isospin-breaking effects paves the way for future studies of radiative corrections in a broader class of weak decay processes.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138034\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matteo","last_name":"Di Carlo","fullName":"Di Carlo, Matteo","id":"262837","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"652b95af5bd90a0508c9b60e03dc4f6f","db_id":262837,"person_id":225869}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matteo","last_name":"Di Carlo","fullName":"Di Carlo, Matteo","id":"262837","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"652b95af5bd90a0508c9b60e03dc4f6f","db_id":262837,"person_id":225869}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quark and lepton flavor physics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"75","db_id":138032,"friendly_id":75,"title":"Kaon leptonic and semileptonic decays with N_f=2+1+1 HISQ fermions","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Current precision tests of the Standard Model (SM) show a deficit in the first row unitarity of the CKM matrix.

Without resorting on nuclear inputs, those can be extracted from the experimental decay width of kaon and pion leptonic decays along with the theoretical calculation of their decay constants, and semileptonic kaon decays along with the corresponding form factor at zero momentum transfer. In this talk we will discuss progress towards a correlated analysis of the lattice inputs needed for this test using highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) on the MILC $N_f=2+1+1$ configurations.\r\n\r\n  We will present the status of a new analysis of light-meson decay constant data where chiral-continuum fits are guided by Staggered Chiral Perturbation Theory (SChPT).

We will also present a reanalysis of our previous kaon semileptonic form factor calculation, aiming to estimate correlations between the form factor and light-meson decay constants.

This issue can be avoided by working with a regulated photon propagator (introducing a Pauli-Villars mass $\\Lambda$) directly in continuum and infinite volume. This feature can be profitably exploited to improve the determination of leading-order electromagnetic corrections to several observables such as the HVP or nucleon masses. In this work we test this strategy for the charged\/neutral pion mass difference  $M_{\\pi^+}-M_{\\pi^0}$ using CLS $n_f=2+1$ ensembles. We show preliminary results addressing both the dependence on the regulator $\\Lambda$ and  the chiral-continuum extrapolation with pion masses between 160 and 280 MeV and lattice spacing in the range $[0.049,0.085]$ fm.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138036\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"De Santis","fullName":"De Santis, Alessandro","id":"262840","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Institut Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz","emailHash":"f6ad3e902e24ccd9a1c18b001a2c1b3c","db_id":262840,"person_id":225482}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"De Santis","fullName":"De Santis, Alessandro","id":"262840","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Institut Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz","emailHash":"f6ad3e902e24ccd9a1c18b001a2c1b3c","db_id":262840,"person_id":225482}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quark and lepton flavor physics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"153","db_id":138039,"friendly_id":153,"title":"Non-perturbative Weak Physics using the FMS Mechanism","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"06:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"07:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The SU(2) gauge symmetry of the weak sector implies that the Higgs vacuum expectation value has to be gauge variant and hence cannot be a physical observable, even though it is generally regarded as such.

In this presentation, we explore the mechanism on the lattice. We will present new results for Higgs and W-boson PDFs from quenched simulations. Further, we present results from simulations with dynamical fermions, identifying different physical regions that exhibit QCD-like and Higgs-like mass hierarchies, where the Higgs is either stable or a resonance. We discuss the operator basis developed to produce lepton scattering lengths from a L\u00fcscher analysis, as well as preliminary spectral functions and extracted scattering amplitudes obtained in the different physical regions.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138039\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sofie","last_name":"Martins","fullName":"Martins, Sofie","id":"262849","affiliation":"University of Graz","emailHash":"f0813e18edb03391ef4cf42cd99682c9","db_id":262849,"person_id":219634}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Axel Torsten","last_name":"Maas","fullName":"Maas, Axel Torsten","id":"262848","affiliation":"University of Graz","emailHash":"89c863df97c88170cc1f72c1580f9f6e","db_id":262848,"person_id":225023},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georg","last_name":"Wieland","fullName":"Wieland, Georg","id":"262850","affiliation":"University of Graz","emailHash":"074f3d5f42fc961105b008b588be7af0","db_id":262850,"person_id":225562},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sofie","last_name":"Martins","fullName":"Martins, Sofie","id":"262849","affiliation":"University of Graz","emailHash":"f0813e18edb03391ef4cf42cd99682c9","db_id":262849,"person_id":219634},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Jenny","fullName":"Jenny, Patrick","id":"262847","affiliation":"University of Graz","emailHash":"2ecfd94629dfbb16becf99143a0e1ad2","db_id":262847,"person_id":225561}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Quark and lepton flavor physics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"212","db_id":138043,"friendly_id":212,"title":"Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation from inexact data","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"06:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"06:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"First-principles prediction of inclusive heavy-particle decay is key to interpreting experimental data and testing the Standard Model.

These developments highlight a profound truth: a nation\u2019s digital future cannot be secure, inclusive, or self-reliant if its foundational technology infrastructure is vulnerable to forces beyond its borders.\r\n\r\nThis challenge becomes even more urgent in the era of Artificial Intelligence. AI is not only shaping industries, economies, and societies, it is also redefining global power balances. From large language models and scientific simulations to defense and healthcare applications, AI relies on massive computing power. If this capacity resides solely in infrastructure controlled elsewhere, the risks to innovation, data sovereignty, and long-term competitiveness are immense. Building sovereign AI infrastructure is therefore central to ensuring nations maintain control over their digital destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nShakti Cloud is one of India\u2019s advanced sovereign platforms for high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. It is powered by NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs (B200 GPUs coming soon) with high-speed interconnects and offers up to 16 exaflops of capacity. It can handle demanding workloads like training state-of-the-art AI models to driving complex scientific research. An important feature of Shakti Cloud is that the entire system is built and operated within India, ensuring that the country\u2019s researchers and enterprises can access world-class infrastructure while retaining control within national boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor researchers and scientists, access to large-scale computing makes it possible to run experiments, train models, and perform simulations at a speed and scale that was previously difficult within India. Shakti Cloud is designed to support these needs with infrastructure that reduces dependence on external providers. Through Shakti AI Lab, universities and institutes can work with ready-to-use environments that come with widely used tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Jupyter, lowering the barriers for students and faculty to begin experimenting with AI. For more advanced projects, Shakti Clusters use orchestration systems like Kubernetes and SLURM to help teams manage and scale complex training jobs. To support deployment, Shakti AI Endpoints enable models to run with low latency across different fields, including healthcare, scientific research, media, and industrial applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nShakti Cloud also provides serverless GPUs and bare metal as a service, creating a flexible and scalable AI infrastructure. This setup supports diverse applications - from education and research to enterprise and national-level AI projects - while keeping computational resources controlled within India. The platform also considers accessibility and resource allocation, offering flexible usage options that allow startups, academic institutions, and research labs to access high-performance computing without long-term commitments. Overall, Shakti Cloud represents an effort to develop sovereign AI infrastructure within India. By maintaining control over computational resources domestically, it aims to support researchers, students, and the broader scientific community in pursuing AI and HPC work with greater independence and continuity.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137817\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vishal","last_name":"Aggarwal","fullName":"Aggarwal, Vishal","id":"262148","affiliation":"Yotta","emailHash":null,"db_id":262148,"person_id":225382}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nishi","last_name":"Wadhwani","fullName":"Wadhwani, Nishi","id":"262147","affiliation":"","emailHash":"345eb163b794546825d2e9fcf6886434","db_id":262147,"person_id":225383},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vishal","last_name":"Aggarwal","fullName":"Aggarwal, Vishal","id":"262148","affiliation":"Yotta","emailHash":null,"db_id":262148,"person_id":225382}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Software development and machines","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"302","db_id":138384,"friendly_id":302,"title":"Yotta","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"09:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"10:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":null,"description":"","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138384\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sunil","last_name":"Gupta","fullName":"Gupta, Sunil","id":"263657","affiliation":"Yotta","emailHash":null,"db_id":263657,"person_id":227684}],"primaryauthors":[],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Software development and machines","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-06","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"DeTar","firstName":"Carleton","name":"DeTar, Carleton","last_name":"DeTar","first_name":"Carleton","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Utah","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"DeTar, Carleton","id":220946,"db_id":12730,"person_id":220946,"emailHash":"bf7c4badf538c0d27a95e46900425ffa"}],"title":"Software development and machines","color":"#d0c296","textColor":"#000000","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20937\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":2,"id":"18","db_id":20937,"friendly_id":18,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":25237,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

We propose a unified framework that combines these ideas and evaluate it on three representative targets: the trace of the inverse of the Dirac operator, traces entering the connected pseudoscalar correlator, and disconnected fermion loops. Multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo achieves deflation using a projector derived from the multigrid prolongator $P$, which captures low-mode information of the Wilson\u2013Dirac operator. Probing is implemented by applying distance-$d$ graph colorings to the lattice, which exploit locality to suppress off-diagonal noise. Within each lattice site, further restricting the noise vectors to subsets such as spin or color is referred to as dilution. We observe systematic variance reductions across all problems, with the disconnected case in particular profiting from the complementary strengths of deflation and probing.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137814\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jose Miguel","last_name":"Jimenez Merchan","fullName":"Jimenez Merchan, Jose Miguel","id":"262136","affiliation":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","emailHash":"e0d319537860b43acf2bc7ceac2afa1d","db_id":262136,"person_id":225633}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jose Miguel","last_name":"Jimenez Merchan","fullName":"Jimenez Merchan, Jose Miguel","id":"262136","affiliation":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","emailHash":"e0d319537860b43acf2bc7ceac2afa1d","db_id":262136,"person_id":225633},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mario","last_name":"Papace","fullName":"Papace, Mario","id":"262135","affiliation":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","emailHash":"c367af270859f747482907761948f24a","db_id":262135,"person_id":225636}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Frommer","fullName":"Frommer, Andreas","id":"262134","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e5e421e75f7bad4423a304f327337eb4","db_id":262134,"person_id":225634},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gustavo","last_name":"Ramirez-Hidalgo","fullName":"Ramirez-Hidalgo, Gustavo","id":"262137","affiliation":"F\u00f6rschungzentrum J\u00fclich","emailHash":"e445d91aa74f3abc8a684e84dad94b0b","db_id":262137,"person_id":225635}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Software development and machines","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"142","db_id":137818,"friendly_id":142,"title":"Lattice QCD on the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper and Blackwell Architectures","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The evolution of GPU architectures has fundamentally transformed computational capabilities for Lattice QCD simulations.

Finally, we investigate strong scaling properties of Lattice QCD applications on multi-node NVLink Grace-Blackwell systems.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137818\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mathias","last_name":"Wagner","fullName":"Wagner, Mathias","id":"262150","affiliation":"Nvidia","emailHash":"60953a14afdbc01a70b1636ddfb8d31b","db_id":262150,"person_id":225525}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Balint","last_name":"Joo","fullName":"Joo, Balint","id":"262151","affiliation":"NVIDIA","emailHash":null,"db_id":262151,"person_id":225524},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Evan","last_name":"Weinberg","fullName":"Weinberg, Evan","id":"262153","affiliation":"NVIDIA","emailHash":null,"db_id":262153,"person_id":219735},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiqun","last_name":"Tu","fullName":"Tu, Jiqun","id":"262149","affiliation":"NVIDIA","emailHash":null,"db_id":262149,"person_id":225523},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kate","last_name":"Clark","fullName":"Clark, Kate","id":"262152","affiliation":"NVIDIA","emailHash":null,"db_id":262152,"person_id":219731},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mathias","last_name":"Wagner","fullName":"Wagner, Mathias","id":"262150","affiliation":"Nvidia","emailHash":"60953a14afdbc01a70b1636ddfb8d31b","db_id":262150,"person_id":225525}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Software development and machines","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"174","db_id":137816,"friendly_id":174,"title":"Could photonic integrated circuits have an impact on lattice QCD?","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations are pushing the limits of today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers. Since most resources are consumed in solving large systems of linear equations, efficient solvers, such as those based on adaptive multigrid methods, are essential. However, with the slowdown of Moore\u2019s Law, it is uncertain whether traditional architectures can deliver the computational power and energy efficiency needed for future LQCD computations. In this talk, we explore photonic computing as a promising emerging paradigm to extend performance in the post-Moore\u2019s Law era. By using photons instead of electrons, photonic processors enable ultra-low latency and energy-efficient matrix operations. To deal with the limited precision of the analog hardware, we introduce a mixed-precision photonic (MPP) solver based on multigrid methods, and present tests on a simple discretized partial differential equation as well as an emulated MPP solver applied to the 2D U(1) Schwinger model. Potential performance gains in both speed and energy efficiency are estimated to reach an order of magnitude, highlighting the potential of domain-specific photonic hardware to accelerate future LQCD calculations.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137816\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Timoteo","last_name":"Lee","fullName":"Lee, Timoteo","id":"262144","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":"13f0f79c4baa7259425db430e9871233","db_id":262144,"person_id":225665}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Timoteo","last_name":"Lee","fullName":"Lee, Timoteo","id":"262144","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":"13f0f79c4baa7259425db430e9871233","db_id":262144,"person_id":225665}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Br\u00fcckerhoff-Pl\u00fcckelmann","fullName":"Br\u00fcckerhoff-Pl\u00fcckelmann, Frank","id":"262143","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":null,"db_id":262143,"person_id":225667},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Pawlowski","fullName":"Pawlowski, Jan","id":"262145","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":null,"db_id":262145,"person_id":225666},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wolfram","last_name":"Pernice","fullName":"Pernice, Wolfram","id":"262146","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":null,"db_id":262146,"person_id":225664}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Software development and machines","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"24","db_id":137815,"friendly_id":24,"title":"Improving HISQ Propagator solves using multigrid","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG69","room":"AG69","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, employing mixed precision and even-odd preconditioning, is typically used when computing propagators for highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ).

In previous work, we addressed this issue using deflation, which significantly reduced solve times\u2014achieving speedups of up to 10$\\times$ over CG on the most challenging ensembles, albeit with a substantial setup cost to compute eigenvectors. In this work, we focus on a multigrid algorithm for HISQ propagators tuned to achieve optimal performance.

While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables and ground state properties. I will present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. I will demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg XXZ model, comparing their performance and presenting the newly discovered schemes. Finally, I will discuss ongoing efforts to extend this framework to even higher orders and apply the derived schemes to quantum hardware, pushing the boundaries of both theoretical advancements and practical quantum computing.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137479\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marko","last_name":"Male\u017ei\u010d","fullName":"Male\u017ei\u010d, Marko","id":"261397","affiliation":"University of Bonn \/ Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics","emailHash":"f8f6a71623293f781cd45e52e2551a0c","db_id":261397,"person_id":224661}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marko","last_name":"Male\u017ei\u010d","fullName":"Male\u017ei\u010d, Marko","id":"261397","affiliation":"University of Bonn \/ Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics","emailHash":"f8f6a71623293f781cd45e52e2551a0c","db_id":261397,"person_id":224661}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":"261396","affiliation":"University Bonn","emailHash":"c6888df74500eeb96af4cac5b0ef6593","db_id":261396,"person_id":224662}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Poster session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"22","db_id":137478,"friendly_id":22,"title":"The matrix model of two-color one-flavor QCD: The ultra-strong coupling regime","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"15:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":90,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"","type":"Poster","description":"We use variational methods to numerically study the matrix model for two-color QCD coupled to a single quark (matrix-QCD\\(_{2,1}\\)) in the ultra-strong Yang--Mills coupling \\((g = \\infty)\\).

The dual model is obtained by making a series of iterative canonical transformations on the electric field operators and their conjugate vector potentials associated with the links around each plaquette. This transformation maps the original gauge degrees of freedom to dual variables defined on plaquettes: SU(N) magnetic scalar fields corresponding to plaquette flux operators, and their conjugate electric scalar potentials. Under SU(N) gauge transformations, both transform like adjoint matter fields. The dual Hamiltonian describes the nonlocal self-interactions of these plaquette flux loops in terms of the electric scalar potentials and with inverted coupling. We show that these nonlocal loop interactions can be made local and converted into minimal couplings by introducing SU(N) auxiliary gauge fields along with\r\nnew plaquette constraints. Our construction completely simplifies the magnetic part of the Hamiltonian, which dominates near the continuum (g\u00b2 \u2192 0) limit.\r\n\r\nExploiting these exact duality transformations, we construct the most general disorder operator for SU(N) lattice gauge theory. These disorder operators, defined on the plaquettes and characterized by (N-1) angles, are the creation and annihilation or the shift operators for the SU(N) magnetic vortices carrying (N-1) types of magnetic fluxes. They are dual to the SU(N) Wilson loop order operators which, on the other hand, are the creation-annihilation or shift operators for the (N-1) electric fluxes on their loops. We derive a new order-disorder algebra involving SU(N) Wigner-D matrices that reduce to standard Wilson-\u2019t Hooft algebra in a special limit. We also compute the path integral expression for the vortex-free energy, which should be useful for Monte Carlo simulations and to understand the role of magnetic vortices and their condensation, if any, in the colour confinement.\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

These radial updates facilitate jumps over the potential barriers, thereby restoring ergodicity while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times at a comparably low computational cost.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137476\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Kennedy","fullName":"Kennedy, Anthony","id":"261388","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e270ddc1022312a20f37e9ddcaec9c36","db_id":261388,"person_id":224680},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":"261386","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"c6888df74500eeb96af4cac5b0ef6593","db_id":261386,"person_id":224662}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Finn","last_name":"Temmen","fullName":"Temmen, Finn","id":"261387","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"850170b0a551ead8169387b1dba80a6f","db_id":261387,"person_id":224682}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Kennedy","fullName":"Kennedy, Anthony","id":"261388","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e270ddc1022312a20f37e9ddcaec9c36","db_id":261388,"person_id":224680},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Evan","last_name":"Berkowitz","fullName":"Berkowitz, Evan","id":"261389","affiliation":"Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich","emailHash":"f45fb38ed1ca11e9497ebf00a94ea01c","db_id":261389,"person_id":224681},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johann","last_name":"Ostmeyer","fullName":"Ostmeyer, Johann","id":"261386","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"c6888df74500eeb96af4cac5b0ef6593","db_id":261386,"person_id":224662},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Luu","fullName":"Luu, Thomas","id":"261384","affiliation":"University of Bonn","emailHash":"e7b0859c28cff415e075ec67ec9fec5d","db_id":261384,"person_id":224678},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xinhao","last_name":"Yu","fullName":"Yu, Xinhao","id":"261385","affiliation":"University of Edinburgh","emailHash":"c349bfea34bfe9b391d8774c3dab1dbf","db_id":261385,"person_id":224679}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Poster session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"225","db_id":137483,"friendly_id":225,"title":"Lattice study of RG flow in 2D phi4 theory","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"15:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":90,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"","type":"Poster","description":"In two dimensions, the phi4 theory exhibits a non-trivial infrared fixed\r\npoint that governs the continuum limit and connects to the Ising universality class.

However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, highlighting the need for robust diagnostics. Existing checks, such as monitoring drift distributions, are useful but indirect. We propose a complementary test based on the configurational temperature, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based criteria, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and provides a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. Using one-dimensional PT-symmetric models, we show that it reproduces the input temperature with high precision and sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While demonstrated in simple systems, the method extends naturally to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also provide an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results indicate that configurational temperature can enhance CLM reliability across a broad range of applications, including lattice QCD at finite density.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137485\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anosh","last_name":"Joseph","fullName":"Joseph, Anosh","id":"261418","affiliation":"University of the Witwatersrand","emailHash":"888d6da58c8f7e698f05302bdae4e7ec","db_id":261418,"person_id":225660}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anosh","last_name":"Joseph","fullName":"Joseph, Anosh","id":"261418","affiliation":"University of the Witwatersrand","emailHash":"888d6da58c8f7e698f05302bdae4e7ec","db_id":261418,"person_id":225660}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arpith","last_name":"Kumar","fullName":"Kumar, Arpith","id":"261417","affiliation":"Central China Normal University","emailHash":"f6d36c3cb60f53ff2afa67e9a8ac7701","db_id":261417,"person_id":225442}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Poster session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"287","db_id":137482,"friendly_id":287,"title":"Multicritical Behavior in a Three-Dimensional Gross\u2013Neveu Model with Staggered Fermions","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"15:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":90,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"","type":"Poster","description":"We study the phase diagram of massless staggered fermions with two distinct four-fermion couplings, U and U\u2032, on a three-dimensional Euclidean lattice using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method.

Using the background field method and improved lattice actions, we compute the renormalization factor of the coupling constant and thus determine the beta-function. In this framework, we calculate, up to two-loop order, the contributions proportional to the quark mass arising in the background gluon propagator. The number of colors $N_c$ and the number of  quark flavors $N_f$ are kept arbitrary throughout the calculation. We employ clover fermions together with Symanzik-improved gauge actions, involving Wilson loops with 4 and 6 links. This allows us to isolate the lattice artifacts that affect the determination of the running coupling. The removal of these effects is essential for high-precision, non-perturbative determinations of the strong coupling constant from lattice simulations.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137493\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Demetrianos","last_name":"Gavriel","fullName":"Gavriel, Demetrianos","id":"261446","affiliation":"University of Parma, INFN Parma, University of Cyprus","emailHash":"3a99a450fa4a452807d308da47d764e7","db_id":261446,"person_id":223690}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Demetrianos","last_name":"Gavriel","fullName":"Gavriel, Demetrianos","id":"261446","affiliation":"University of Parma, INFN Parma, University of Cyprus","emailHash":"3a99a450fa4a452807d308da47d764e7","db_id":261446,"person_id":223690},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gregoris","last_name":"Spanoudes","fullName":"Spanoudes, Gregoris","id":"261448","affiliation":"University of Cyprus","emailHash":"79442eeec875a678fdf0be5c3f03b950","db_id":261448,"person_id":223689},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haralambos","last_name":"Panagopoulos","fullName":"Panagopoulos, Haralambos","id":"261447","affiliation":"University of Cyprus","emailHash":"c2e774094c7e19650df269ba4b63260c","db_id":261447,"person_id":223688},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marios","last_name":"Costa","fullName":"Costa, Marios","id":"261445","affiliation":"Cyprus University of Technology, University of Cyprus, Rinnoco Ltd","emailHash":"3a29c95f8a1e9c25f664338ce9dcdd33","db_id":261445,"person_id":223691}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Poster session","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"240","db_id":137494,"friendly_id":240,"title":"Efficient Low-Mode Averaging for Meson and Baryon Correlators at the Physical Point","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"13:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"15:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":90,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"","type":"Poster","description":"We present an analysis of deflation and low-mode averaging techniques applied to two- and three-point correlation functions of mesons and baryons at the physical point.

For the isoscalar quark parton distribution function, I will present our computation using the pseudo-distribution framework on a single ensemble of Nf = 2+1 Wilson-Clover fermions.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137769\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Monahan","fullName":"Monahan, Christopher","id":"261936","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a3531bd6ea76d50b742667b0a7c63ab1","db_id":261936,"person_id":225627}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Monahan","fullName":"Monahan, Christopher","id":"261936","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a3531bd6ea76d50b742667b0a7c63ab1","db_id":261936,"person_id":225627}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Liu","firstName":"Kehfei","name":"Liu, Kehfei","last_name":"Liu","first_name":"Kehfei","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Liu, Kehfei","id":224928,"db_id":12731,"person_id":224928,"emailHash":"0f7eb7bb118e88020e5ad7a30aa3fa84"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Monahan","firstName":"Christopher","name":"Monahan, Christopher","last_name":"Monahan","first_name":"Christopher","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Monahan, Christopher","id":225627,"db_id":12735,"person_id":225627,"emailHash":"a3531bd6ea76d50b742667b0a7c63ab1"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Pefkou","firstName":"Dimitra","name":"Pefkou, Dimitra","last_name":"Pefkou","first_name":"Dimitra","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Pefkou, Dimitra","id":225886,"db_id":12732,"person_id":225886,"emailHash":"dba739c7a04e6efffd6052ca64e4bb16"}],"title":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","color":"#0d316f","textColor":"#eff5ff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20939\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":6,"id":"20","db_id":20939,"friendly_id":20,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"AG80","roomFullname":"AG80","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Liu","firstName":"Kehfei","name":"Liu, Kehfei","last_name":"Liu","first_name":"Kehfei","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Liu, Kehfei","id":224928,"db_id":12731,"person_id":224928,"emailHash":"0f7eb7bb118e88020e5ad7a30aa3fa84"}],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24746,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Recently, multiple predictions for hadron structure functions have been derived and compared with experimental measurements and lattice QCD calculations, finding a general agreement. In order to explore the precision of the instanton liquid model, one has to compare its predictions with non-perturbative simulations in a regime dominated by instanton dynamics. \r\nThis has been performed for two gluon-sensitive observables: the gluon Green's function and  the strong running coupling constant [1]. In this contribution, we propose to study a fermionic observable, the pion vector form factor, for which instanton liquid model predictions have been discussed in [1].

Traditionally, the external field two-point function method has been used to calculate polarizabilities. However, recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of using four-point functions for computing polarizabilities of charged and neutral hadrons. Our previous study on the electric polarizability of the charged pion used a quenched Wilson action on a lattice with pion mass from 1100 MeV to 370 MeV. In this work, we employ a number of improvements, including a dynamical action (nHYP), smaller pion masses, and a variable lattice size in order to extrapolate to infinite volume. I will describe the analysis procedure, some early results, and expectations for future work.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137777\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Luke","fullName":"Luke, Benjamin","id":"261961","affiliation":"Baylor University","emailHash":"3e4811d7b401f900b61d59e3ecc14307","db_id":261961,"person_id":224386}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Luke","fullName":"Luke, Benjamin","id":"261961","affiliation":"Baylor University","emailHash":"3e4811d7b401f900b61d59e3ecc14307","db_id":261961,"person_id":224386},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Lee","fullName":"Lee, Frank","id":"261960","affiliation":"George Washington University","emailHash":"87de6b07943c7b5fbc31cfe5ae00d3c4","db_id":261960,"person_id":224388},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shayan","last_name":"Nadeem","fullName":"Nadeem, Shayan","id":"261958","affiliation":"Baylor University","emailHash":"c5c6cb86dce0213ea1843e580d4943fb","db_id":261958,"person_id":224384},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sudip","last_name":"Shiwakoti","fullName":"Shiwakoti, Sudip","id":"261957","affiliation":"Baylor University","emailHash":"97518336b4b5fc3dd345b829d9be21b9","db_id":261957,"person_id":224385},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Walter","last_name":"Wilcox","fullName":"Wilcox, Walter","id":"261959","affiliation":"Baylor University","emailHash":"cbe44cb0040cbda48a7b001d227c72ef","db_id":261959,"person_id":224387}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"209","db_id":137779,"friendly_id":209,"title":"The Electromagnetic Form Factor of the Rho Meson on the Lattice","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-05","time":"05:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"AG80","room":"AG80","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The calculation of the hadronic form factors on the lattice provides important information about the internal structure of the corresponding states. However, calculating the form factor for unstable states, viz. resonances, is not as straightforward, both from the conceptual point of view and in terms of technical implementation. In this work, we specifically consider the electromagnetic form factor of the $\\rho$-meson. It is well known that the matrix element of the current between two eigenstates of the lattice Hamiltonian with energies close to the resonance mass does not possess a well-defined infinite-volume limit, even if the Lellouch-L\u00fcscher factors for the external legs are properly taken into account. The reason for this is that the triangle diagram, where the external current is hooked on to one of the constituents of the resonance, does not exhibit a regular dependence on the box size.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we make use of the external field method (the Feynman-Hellmann method), where the system is placed in an external field, coupling to a spatially periodic current. The structure of the finite-volume energy levels is described by the modified L\u00fcscher equation, which enables one to directly extract the short-range part of the interaction with the external field from the fit to the shifted energy levels. This method has the advantage that the separation of the triangle diagram is automatically taken into account, and the short-range interaction has a regular dependence on L, which is exponentially suppressed for large L. Through this work, we provide complete framework for the extraction of the form factor from raw lattice data, when available. We, in addition, provide a crude estimate of the short-range contribution to the form factor at the lowest order in ChPT.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137779\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ajay Shanmuga","last_name":"Sakthivasan","fullName":"Sakthivasan, Ajay Shanmuga","id":"261964","affiliation":"HISKP, University of Bonn","emailHash":"a6a5d68d32d45b888a640aa3778ecedf","db_id":261964,"person_id":225752}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ajay Shanmuga","last_name":"Sakthivasan","fullName":"Sakthivasan, Ajay Shanmuga","id":"261964","affiliation":"HISKP, University of Bonn","emailHash":"a6a5d68d32d45b888a640aa3778ecedf","db_id":261964,"person_id":225752}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Akaki","last_name":"Rusetsky","fullName":"Rusetsky, Akaki","id":"261967","affiliation":"HISKP, University of Bonn","emailHash":"b31a3882f27a3e0fe3e019676d612e73","db_id":261967,"person_id":225753},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gerrit","last_name":"Schierholz","fullName":"Schierholz, Gerrit","id":"261968","affiliation":"Deutsche Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg","emailHash":null,"db_id":261968,"person_id":225751},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jia-Jun","last_name":"Wu","fullName":"Wu, Jia-Jun","id":"261966","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing","emailHash":null,"db_id":261966,"person_id":225750},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ulf","last_name":"Mei\u00dfner","fullName":"Mei\u00dfner, Ulf","id":"261965","affiliation":"HISKP, University of Bonn","emailHash":null,"db_id":261965,"person_id":225749}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Liu","firstName":"Kehfei","name":"Liu, Kehfei","last_name":"Liu","first_name":"Kehfei","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Liu, Kehfei","id":224928,"db_id":12731,"person_id":224928,"emailHash":"0f7eb7bb118e88020e5ad7a30aa3fa84"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Monahan","firstName":"Christopher","name":"Monahan, Christopher","last_name":"Monahan","first_name":"Christopher","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Monahan, Christopher","id":225627,"db_id":12735,"person_id":225627,"emailHash":"a3531bd6ea76d50b742667b0a7c63ab1"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Pefkou","firstName":"Dimitra","name":"Pefkou, Dimitra","last_name":"Pefkou","first_name":"Dimitra","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Pefkou, Dimitra","id":225886,"db_id":12732,"person_id":225886,"emailHash":"dba739c7a04e6efffd6052ca64e4bb16"}],"title":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","color":"#0d316f","textColor":"#eff5ff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20939\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":6,"id":"20","db_id":20939,"friendly_id":20,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"AG80","roomFullname":"AG80","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24768,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Employing a novel Coulomb-gauge-fixed lattice QCD approach at physical quark masses, we reliably access transverse separations up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to the small transverse momenta relevant for EIC measurements. In this presentation, we summarize recent lattice QCD advancements, systematically progressing from foundational calculations of the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel to detailed studies of pion and proton TMD structures. Our calculations include a first-principles determination of the nonperturbative CS kernel, crucial for describing the rapidity evolution of TMDs. Extending these methodologies, we investigate pion valence-quark TMD distributions, providing new insights into the internal transverse structure of the pion. Most significantly, our benchmark computations for proton helicity and flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs reveal similarities in transverse dependence between helicity and unpolarized distributions at moderate momentum fractions, alongside discernible flavor-dependent variations. Collectively, these lattice results pave the way, for the first time, toward direct QCD-based comparisons and serve as essential guidance for phenomenological parametrizations derived from global analyses of experimental data.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137789\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Swagato","last_name":"Mukherjee","fullName":"Mukherjee, Swagato","id":"262016","affiliation":"","emailHash":"6567fbf8f5b7e140f7a1b81fe83d35b2","db_id":262016,"person_id":224895}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Swagato","last_name":"Mukherjee","fullName":"Mukherjee, Swagato","id":"262016","affiliation":"","emailHash":"6567fbf8f5b7e140f7a1b81fe83d35b2","db_id":262016,"person_id":224895}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Liu","firstName":"Kehfei","name":"Liu, Kehfei","last_name":"Liu","first_name":"Kehfei","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Liu, Kehfei","id":224928,"db_id":12731,"person_id":224928,"emailHash":"0f7eb7bb118e88020e5ad7a30aa3fa84"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Monahan","firstName":"Christopher","name":"Monahan, Christopher","last_name":"Monahan","first_name":"Christopher","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Monahan, Christopher","id":225627,"db_id":12735,"person_id":225627,"emailHash":"a3531bd6ea76d50b742667b0a7c63ab1"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Pefkou","firstName":"Dimitra","name":"Pefkou, Dimitra","last_name":"Pefkou","first_name":"Dimitra","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Pefkou, Dimitra","id":225886,"db_id":12732,"person_id":225886,"emailHash":"dba739c7a04e6efffd6052ca64e4bb16"}],"title":"Structure of hadrons and nuclei","color":"#0d316f","textColor":"#eff5ff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20939\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":6,"id":"20","db_id":20939,"friendly_id":20,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"AG69","roomFullname":"AG69","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Monahan","firstName":"Christopher","name":"Monahan, Christopher","last_name":"Monahan","first_name":"Christopher","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Monahan, Christopher","id":225627,"db_id":12735,"person_id":225627,"emailHash":"a3531bd6ea76d50b742667b0a7c63ab1"}],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":25169,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Our simulations cover a temperature range from 140 to 250 MeV for two lattice spacings, corresponding to temporal extents of $N_t = 12$ and $16$, with aspect ratios $N_s\/N_t$ between 3 and 4. This setup allows us to control for finite-volume and discretization effects. The chiral condensate for domain wall fermions contains ultraviolet-divergent contributions stemming from the finite input quark mass and residual chiral symmetry breaking. We will discuss our method for subtracting these contributions to obtain a renormalized chiral condensate. Our result shows that the disconnected chiral susceptibility develops a pronounced peak whose height does not increase with increasing volume. This suggests that the transition is a smooth crossover rather than first-order. We will report the pseudo-critical temperature and its dependence on the lattice spacing.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137999\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yu","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Yu","id":"262688","affiliation":"Bielefeld University","emailHash":"03e4a026426b8538aeb70546012b921c","db_id":262688,"person_id":224551}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yu","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Yu","id":"262688","affiliation":"Bielefeld University","emailHash":"03e4a026426b8538aeb70546012b921c","db_id":262688,"person_id":224551}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hidenori","last_name":"Fukaya","fullName":"Fukaya, Hidenori","id":"262687","affiliation":"The University of Osaka","emailHash":"7f79ff25b353168650bfb1903513be66","db_id":262687,"person_id":224651},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Issaku","last_name":"Kanamori","fullName":"Kanamori, Issaku","id":"262689","affiliation":"R-CCS, RIKEN","emailHash":"a07b74016c4747943da579ecb0a5d07a","db_id":262689,"person_id":225676},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jishnu","last_name":"Goswami","fullName":"Goswami, Jishnu","id":"262691","affiliation":"Bielefeld University","emailHash":"c5e8ec8c712ea5f049e8599491b18537","db_id":262691,"person_id":225675},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shoji","last_name":"Hashimoto","fullName":"Hashimoto, Shoji","id":"262692","affiliation":"KEK","emailHash":"9e10422cb46785c2ae54aa0cad456119","db_id":262692,"person_id":225505},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yasumichi","last_name":"Aoki","fullName":"Aoki, Yasumichi","id":"262690","affiliation":"","emailHash":"83729af767fcb7e8651d6863675d8892","db_id":262690,"person_id":224802}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"120","db_id":137998,"friendly_id":120,"title":"QCD phase transition with overlap fermions","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present an update of our lattice study of QCD phase transition with dynamical overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing.

Once the number of massless fermions exceeds a critical value, $N_f^*$\u200b, QCD enters the conformal window and becomes chirally symmetric already in the vacuum. Determining $N_f^*$\u200b has long been a challenge in lattice QCD, as simulations are performed away from the chiral and continuum limits, thus allowing spontaneous symmetry breaking and thermal transitions even for $N_f \\ge N_f^*\u200b$. An additional difficulty in the relevant low-temperature region of lattice parameter space is the appearance of an unphysical bulk transition $-$ a discretization artifact that may mask the genuine thermal transition. In this work, we approach the chiral limit by mapping out the phase boundary of the chiral transition in an extended parameter space spanned by the gauge coupling, the number of unimproved staggered fermions, their masses, and the lattice spacing. Our study of the thermal phase transition suggests that, in continuum QCD, the chiral transition is of second order for all $N_f$ up to the onset of the conformal window. At the same time, by mapping out the bulk transition for various $N_f$\u200b and analyzing its interplay with the thermal transition, we obtain a more refined picture of the general lattice phase structure. Building upon previous studies of many-flavour QCD at $T=0$ and $am=0$, we present an extended lattice phase diagram in terms of $N_t$, $\\beta$, $am$, and $N_f$. This understanding of how the conformal window connects to lattice QCD at finite spacing and mass might provide new strategies for inferring the onset of the conformal window from simulations performed away from the chiral and continuum limits.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138000\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jan Philipp","last_name":"Klinger","fullName":"Klinger, Jan Philipp","id":"262695","affiliation":"Goethe University Frankfurt","emailHash":"003de04699876163beab14da743c5299","db_id":262695,"person_id":225731}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jan Philipp","last_name":"Klinger","fullName":"Klinger, Jan Philipp","id":"262695","affiliation":"Goethe University Frankfurt","emailHash":"003de04699876163beab14da743c5299","db_id":262695,"person_id":225731}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jonas","last_name":"Schaible","fullName":"Schaible, Jonas","id":"262696","affiliation":"","emailHash":"46226cb79a339d4a557eaed73237080a","db_id":262696,"person_id":225732},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Owe","last_name":"Philipsen","fullName":"Philipsen, Owe","id":"262694","affiliation":"","emailHash":"10a48632045c598a959bae6d13b85c42","db_id":262694,"person_id":225730},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Reinhold","last_name":"Kaiser","fullName":"Kaiser, Reinhold","id":"262693","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e333ca0fcfb3870dfc17e17181e7e029","db_id":262693,"person_id":225729}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"234","db_id":138001,"friendly_id":234,"title":"Investigating Phase Structure of three-flavor QCD with Domain Wall Fermions at Finite Temperature","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Phase boundary in the lower left corner of Columbia plot has been studied extensively.

We also investigate the non-strangeness neutral scenario, and discuss possible implications for the existence of a critical point.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138005\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Piyush","last_name":"Kumar","fullName":"Kumar, Piyush","id":"262717","affiliation":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","emailHash":"5571abe14ce50c78322cdca9db485bdb","db_id":262717,"person_id":225812}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Piyush","last_name":"Kumar","fullName":"Kumar, Piyush","id":"262717","affiliation":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","emailHash":"5571abe14ce50c78322cdca9db485bdb","db_id":262717,"person_id":225812}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Attila","last_name":"Pasztor","fullName":"Pasztor, Attila","id":"262719","affiliation":"E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University","emailHash":"72df1e66b49349350b6c7fd382a0093e","db_id":262719,"person_id":225814},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chik Him","last_name":"Wong","fullName":"Wong, Chik Him","id":"262721","affiliation":"","emailHash":"d3c04f035dad75ceb3d151ad7dbb65c2","db_id":262721,"person_id":225813},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jana N.","last_name":"Guenther","fullName":"Guenther, Jana N.","id":"262720","affiliation":"University of Wuppertal","emailHash":"3ee8654b3fa7a94ffa99adf1fbdc7200","db_id":262720,"person_id":225811},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Paolo","last_name":"Parotto","fullName":"Parotto, Paolo","id":"262715","affiliation":"","emailHash":"3a72308068f634882af058449df7608b","db_id":262715,"person_id":225810},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Szabolcs Istvan","last_name":"Borsanyi","fullName":"Borsanyi, Szabolcs Istvan","id":"262718","affiliation":"","emailHash":"46d76914780cb9aa62617a384674ded3","db_id":262718,"person_id":225406},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zoltan","last_name":"Fodor","fullName":"Fodor, Zoltan","id":"262716","affiliation":"","emailHash":"bf094e7ae42800647ab10610ea63394d","db_id":262716,"person_id":225403}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[],"title":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","color":"#92b6db","textColor":"#03070f","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20934\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":8,"id":"15","db_id":20934,"friendly_id":15,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24730,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

At finite temperature, screening of the heavy quark anti-quark potential was suggested as the cause of quarkonium melting in quark gluon plasma (QGP). Perturbative QCD calculations within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) on the other hand do not lead to a screened potential in general, and the thermal correction to the potential also has an imaginary part.\r\n\r\nUsing extended operators, we are able to project much better into the lowest states of interest, which is needed due to the short extent in temporal direction at finite temperature, which otherwise is obscured by the continuum contribution. These results show a picture of no shift in the overall energy of the charmonium states, similar to the results from NRQCD for bottomonium [2] or for the potential extracted from Wilson line correlators [3].\r\n\r\nInstead, all of these results show a picture of the spectral function broadening as the temperature increases, and the distance between the quarks increases. We use the vacuum wave function of different charmonium states and the imaginary part of the potential obtained by us on the lattice [3] to estimate the size of in-medium widths of $J\/\\psi(1S)$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\eta _c(1S)$, $\\eta _c(2S)$, $\\chi _{c0}(1P)$ and $\\chi _{c1}(1P)$ at finite temperature and compare with lattice results.\r\n\r\n[1] Rasmus N.

Several different methods are on the market to resolve this issue, each taking different approaches and assumptions. The aim of this talk is to compare some of the reconstruction techniques including machine learning methods on mock data to spot systematic errors and shortcomings of certain reconstruction techniques. We then apply the reconstruction techniques to lattice simulation data to extract the spectral function.

In this work, we investigate the potential between static quarks at nonzero baryon chemical potential using Taylor-expanded Wilson line correlators. Simulations are carried out in (2+1)-flavor QCD at physical quark masses with the HISQ action on ensembles generated by the HotQCD collaboration.

With only Euclidean correlators as input, this procedure has fundamentally limited frequency resolution of order of pi*T. On the other hand, at sufficiently high temperatures gauge fields become almost classical and practically do not depend on Euclidean time, effectively reducing to three-dimensional static fields. We demonstrate that at sufficiently high temperatures, finite-temperature dimensional reduction allows to extract much more information on fermionic spectral functions from Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo simulations. With a good precision, spectral functions can be calculated for a single fermion moving in the background of static, disordered gauge fields, which is a polynomial-complexity problem. We first test this approach in 1+1-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory with dynamical fermions and demonstrate excellent agreement with spectral functions calculated from exact diagonalisation of the full quantum Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate that dimensional reduction also works well for Euclidean-time meson correlators in high-temperature lattice QCD.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138057\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavel","last_name":"Buividovich","fullName":"Buividovich, Pavel","id":"262944","affiliation":"","emailHash":"98f206687990a96030f79d74a49ac444","db_id":262944,"person_id":225657}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Hind","fullName":"Hind, Ben","id":"262943","affiliation":"University of Liverpool","emailHash":"38752c223ee6d0697bb9481461a96d2d","db_id":262943,"person_id":225658},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavel","last_name":"Buividovich","fullName":"Buividovich, Pavel","id":"262944","affiliation":"","emailHash":"98f206687990a96030f79d74a49ac444","db_id":262944,"person_id":225657}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"67","db_id":138056,"friendly_id":67,"title":"Shear Viscosity:  Renormalization of the EMT in Full QCD","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"The determination of shear viscosity in quark-gluon plasma from first principle has remained one of the most challenging problems for decades, despite its significant importance in research fields such as hydrodynamics and cosmology. It has been studied in pure-glue theory on the lattice, but its investigation in full QCD is particularly complex. One of the main reasons for this complexity is the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) on the lattice. In this work, we use the gradient flow method to construct the renormalized EMT. In full QCD, the shear viscosity requires one extra renormalization coefficient, arising from the fermionic component of the EMT. We use enthalpy density to fix these renormalization coefficients using an imaginary isospin chemical potential. We measure the number density to obtain the pressure and then the interaction measure to determine the enthalpy density on the lattice. The corresponding EMT component is then measured to fix the lattice renormalization. Finally, we report progress on extracting the renormalization coefficients and discuss their connection to shear viscosity.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138056\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavan","last_name":"Pavan","fullName":"Pavan, Pavan","id":"262938","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a8985b61fc2ee1fb1d752b50751b2bcd","db_id":262938,"person_id":224550}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Schmidt-Sonntag","fullName":"Schmidt-Sonntag, Christian","id":"262939","affiliation":"","emailHash":"3507c7e923df84608c68e193cce9182d","db_id":262939,"person_id":224549},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Guy","last_name":"Moore","fullName":"Moore, Guy","id":"262940","affiliation":"TU Darmstadt","emailHash":"4c1eb737a09c9bba21e0266be2632f29","db_id":262940,"person_id":224552},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kaczmarek","fullName":"Kaczmarek, Olaf","id":"262937","affiliation":"","emailHash":"cb4a95098e3d70f5197766e4930f78f6","db_id":262937,"person_id":224468},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavan","last_name":"Pavan","fullName":"Pavan, Pavan","id":"262938","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a8985b61fc2ee1fb1d752b50751b2bcd","db_id":262938,"person_id":224550},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rasmus","last_name":"Larsen","fullName":"Larsen, Rasmus","id":"262941","affiliation":"Bielefeld University","emailHash":"c6f9161614ff97dbff2a3cdd80359d36","db_id":262941,"person_id":224117},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yu","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Yu","id":"262942","affiliation":"Bielefeld University","emailHash":"03e4a026426b8538aeb70546012b921c","db_id":262942,"person_id":224551}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[],"title":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","color":"#92b6db","textColor":"#03070f","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20934\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":8,"id":"15","db_id":20934,"friendly_id":15,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24752,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

By performing lattice computations of the spatial Wilson line correlators for a wide range of temperatures from $160$-$1000$ MeV on different lattice spacings corresponding to $N_\\tau=8, 12, 16$ for pure SU(3) gauge theory and $N_\\tau=8, 10$ for 2+1 flavor QCD we extract the spatial string tension. From the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension we show that QCD can be described by a dimensional reduced effective theory, EQCD, at temperatures beyond $700$ MeV. We further extract the pseudo-potential whose long distance properties are characterized by the spatial string tension and the short distance perturbative part is described within EQCD. We demonstrate how this potential can explain the deviation of the pseudo-scalar and vector screening masses  from their perturbative estimates at temperatures as high as $100$ GeV. We also derive the spin-spin interaction potential within EQCD and demonstrate how well it can explain the mass splitting between pseudo-scalar and vector screening masses at high temperatures.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138018\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sayantan","last_name":"Sharma","fullName":"Sharma, Sayantan","id":"262765","affiliation":"IMSc","emailHash":"b31b74e4ff5ebc2b24b33ae76cb1441b","db_id":262765,"person_id":220678}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sayantan","last_name":"Sharma","fullName":"Sharma, Sayantan","id":"262765","affiliation":"IMSc","emailHash":"b31b74e4ff5ebc2b24b33ae76cb1441b","db_id":262765,"person_id":220678}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dibyendu","last_name":"Bala","fullName":"Bala, Dibyendu","id":"262767","affiliation":"Bielefeld University","emailHash":"2146a4d5b336205089089516e604dcbf","db_id":262767,"person_id":224469},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kaczmarek","fullName":"Kaczmarek, Olaf","id":"262766","affiliation":"","emailHash":"cb4a95098e3d70f5197766e4930f78f6","db_id":262766,"person_id":224468},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Petreczky","fullName":"Petreczky, Peter","id":"262769","affiliation":"","emailHash":"9e86ae285689f7141a31c6ea60f4bdfd","db_id":262769,"person_id":223814},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Swagatam","last_name":"Tah","fullName":"Tah, Swagatam","id":"262768","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences","emailHash":"a2e2c6d67bb4195d84920423aae97746","db_id":262768,"person_id":224470}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[],"title":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","color":"#92b6db","textColor":"#03070f","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20934\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":8,"id":"15","db_id":20934,"friendly_id":15,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24777,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

The method has been generalized from real to complex scalar fields and from one-dimensional to multidimensional configurations, allowing a detailed analysis of spatially varying condensates.\r\nBy employing the extended k-Shape method, we can extract detailed information about phase structure that is not easily accessible through conventional techniques. In the uniform, chiral-symmetry-broken phase, the phase structure can be characterized sufficiently by the expectation value of the configuration. Near the phase boundary, however, the k-Shape method reveals smooth variations in the configuration pattern, providing a sensitive probe of the transition region.The extended k-Shape method can analyze spatial dependencies that do not resemble simple sinusoidal waves. This makes it particularly suitable for identifying nontrivial spatial patterns that emerge in inhomogeneous condensate. In kink-like configurations, for example, the minimum of the correlation function is not necessarily negative, indicating a richer structure than can be captured by traditional correlation analysis.\r\nThese results demonstrate that the k-Shape approach offers a powerful and versatile framework for extracting detailed features of phase transitions and for exploring the interplay between uniform and inhomogeneous condensate in lattice field theories.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138061\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chiho","last_name":"Nonaka","fullName":"Nonaka, Chiho","id":"262956","affiliation":"Hiroshima University","emailHash":"89b0a66faae214677f7f35d72f269d2f","db_id":262956,"person_id":225872}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chiho","last_name":"Nonaka","fullName":"Nonaka, Chiho","id":"262956","affiliation":"Hiroshima University","emailHash":"89b0a66faae214677f7f35d72f269d2f","db_id":262956,"person_id":225872},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Keita","last_name":"Horie","fullName":"Horie, Keita","id":"262958","affiliation":"ChudenCTI Co.,Ltd.","emailHash":"26dd9e4862e88ae68a91abb14a4f06d6","db_id":262958,"person_id":225870},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rin","last_name":"Kagami","fullName":"Kagami, Rin","id":"262957","affiliation":"Kyoto University","emailHash":"1501d58ea110c0bc93ca529b6b8c70ec","db_id":262957,"person_id":225871}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"124","db_id":138059,"friendly_id":124,"title":"QCD in strong magnetic fields: fluctuations of conserved charges and EoS","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"10:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"Strong magnetic fields can profoundly affect the equilibrium properties, characterized by the equation of state and bulk thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter.

It is known that the transition is first order in the region of zero density and heavy quark mass, and also first order in the region of light quark mass when the number of flavors is large. The intermediate region is the crossover region, and numerical simulations of lattice QCD have shown that the critical mass at which the first-order phase transition turns into a crossover in the heavy quark region increases with increasing density. When investigating high-density regions in lattice QCD simulations, a problem known as the sign problem arises, making research difficult. However, in regions where quarks are sufficiently heavy, the sign problem is relatively less serious, making research possible. On the other hand, the critical mass at which the first-order phase transition in the light quark region ends is also expected to increase with increasing density. If the region of the first-order phase transition in the light quark regime continues to expand with increasing density, the critical point should reach the heavy quark region where it can be studied.\r\nIn this study, we discuss whether there is a first-order phase transition region in the heavy quark high-density region that is different from the first-order phase transition in the low-density region. There is an effective theory that describes the heavy quark high-density limit of QCD. This effective theory is a simple model in which the Polyakov loop is a dynamical variable, and the quark Boltzmann factor is controlled by only one parameter, $C(\\mu,m)$, which is a function of the mass $m$ and the chemical potential $\\mu$. The Polyakov loop is the order parameter of the Z(3) symmetry that is broken at the finite-temperature phase transition of QCD. We consider that the fundamental properties of a phase transition are determined only by the symmetry broken by the phase transition and the dimension of the space. By using an approximation in which the Polyakov loop is replaced by a Z(3) spin, we find that the effective model is a three-dimensional three-state Potts model (Z(3) spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and apply it to QCD in the heavy quark region. As the density varies from $\\mu=0$ to $\\mu=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138058\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shinji","last_name":"Ejiri","fullName":"Ejiri, Shinji","id":"262946","affiliation":"Niigata University","emailHash":"8d070887bfe9d73826b7e6ab43eb27c3","db_id":262946,"person_id":225242}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shinji","last_name":"Ejiri","fullName":"Ejiri, Shinji","id":"262946","affiliation":"Niigata University","emailHash":"8d070887bfe9d73826b7e6ab43eb27c3","db_id":262946,"person_id":225242}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Masanari","last_name":"Koiida","fullName":"Koiida, Masanari","id":"262945","affiliation":"Niigata University","emailHash":null,"db_id":262945,"person_id":225244},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Toshiki","last_name":"Sato","fullName":"Sato, Toshiki","id":"262947","affiliation":"Niigata University","emailHash":null,"db_id":262947,"person_id":225243}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"248","db_id":138060,"friendly_id":248,"title":"Deconfinement and chiral aspects of the QCD crossover under magnetic fields: static-quark entropy and chiral susceptibility","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We investigate the static-quark entropy in QCD in the presence of external magnetic fields, using its temperature peak as a pseudocritical deconfinement indicator.

We investigate the latter relation by studying the low-lying eigenmodes of the overlap operator in the background of gauge configurations with 2+1+1 quark flavors of twisted-mass Wilson fermions. The mobility edge, below which eigenmodes are localized, is estimated by the inflection point of the relative volume. Contrary to the previous prediction [1], this estimate does not vanish at the temperature of the chiral phase transition [2]. We discuss a possible scenario, supported by literature, for why this could be the case and present an alternative observable as a measure of localization.\r\nSince it is known that external magnetic fields reduce the chiral as well as the deconfinement transition temperature, the second part proceeds with a study of staggered fermions in the presence of different magnetic field strengths.

From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate a typical time-scale of $\\sim 0.50(3)$ fm\/c to achieve thermalization at $T\\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. Next, we have also studied the sphaleron rate in non-Abelian gauge theories both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions.

Focusing on the infrared part of the eigenspectrum that lies within the non-perturbative magnetic scale, we propose suitable observables that allow us to categorize different regions of the eigenspectrum unambiguously. While most of these eigenmodes are completely delocalized and chaotic, i.e. their nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations are similar to random matrices of a Gaussian unitary ensemble, we showed that a classical non-thermal state of SU(3) gauge theory consisting of magnetic gluons is also chaotic, thus a non-trivial realization of the  Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture. This allowed us to estimate an upper bound on the thermalization time $\\sim  1.44$ fm\/c of magnetic gluons by matching the magnetic scales in these two regimes. Furthermore we also observe the appearance of a few eigenmodes in deep-infrared part of the spectrum near and above the chiral crossover temperature, whose fractal dimensions might carry information about the universality class of the chiral transition in QCD.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138012\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"RAVI","last_name":"SHANKER","fullName":"SHANKER, RAVI","id":"262741","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences","emailHash":"2c3e911a00c8ea498050f458ab3c7329","db_id":262741,"person_id":224663}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"RAVI","last_name":"SHANKER","fullName":"SHANKER, RAVI","id":"262741","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences","emailHash":"2c3e911a00c8ea498050f458ab3c7329","db_id":262741,"person_id":224663}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Harshit","last_name":"Pandey","fullName":"Pandey, Harshit","id":"262740","affiliation":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai","emailHash":"9b126cab9dad472e67c6ee1cf06b6b43","db_id":262740,"person_id":220680},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sayantan","last_name":"Sharma","fullName":"Sharma, Sayantan","id":"262739","affiliation":"IMSc","emailHash":"b31b74e4ff5ebc2b24b33ae76cb1441b","db_id":262739,"person_id":220678}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-07","time":"13:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[],"title":"QCD at nonzero temperature and density","color":"#92b6db","textColor":"#03070f","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/20934\/","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"TIFR Mumbai","address":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\n1, Homi Bhabha Road,\nNavy Nagar, Colaba,\nMumbai, India.\nPin - 400 005","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":8,"id":"15","db_id":20934,"friendly_id":15,"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","code":""},"room":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","roomFullname":"Homi Bhabha Auditorium","location":"","inheritLoc":false,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":24588,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

Since lattice simulations are mostly carried out in isospin symmetric QCD, corrections due to the mass difference of the up and down quarks and the coupling to photons have to be accounted for. These isospin breaking effects are of order 1% and can be treated as corrections to the result for the HVP contribution in isospin symmetric QCD. In the current estimate of the HVP contribution, these effects are a large source of uncertainty due to the extensive computational cost to compute all occurring Wick contractions and degrading signal-to-noise behaviour especially for quark disconnected diagrams.\r\n\r\nI present the current status of the calculation of isospin breaking corrections in the HVP contribution for the RBC\/UKQCD Collaboration. We use a dataset of stochastically sampled all-to-all propagators to construct all necessary Wick contractions for the electromagnetic and strong isospin breaking effects. We employ different versions of QED on the lattice, such as QED_L, QED_r and QED_\\infty to check for consistency.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138047\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Parrino","fullName":"Parrino, Julian","id":"262920","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","emailHash":"7832f0dc23f813962dbb56e2a8806248","db_id":262920,"person_id":225468}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Parrino","fullName":"Parrino, Julian","id":"262920","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","emailHash":"7832f0dc23f813962dbb56e2a8806248","db_id":262920,"person_id":225468}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christoph","last_name":"Lehner","fullName":"Lehner, Christoph","id":"262921","affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t Regensburg","emailHash":"ac5b600f1d51468939e6ffe0b985c084","db_id":262921,"person_id":220873}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic contribution to the magnetic moment of muon","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"49","db_id":138042,"friendly_id":49,"title":"Light Quark Connected Hadronic Vacuum Polarization Contribution to muon anomaly via Sparsened Meson Fields","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present an update on our determination of the light-quark connected contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\\mu$, on a finer lattice with  2+1+1 highly-improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensemble from the MILC collaboration with physical pion mass, 0.042 fm lattice spacing, and size $144^3 \\times 288$ sites.

The kernel functions required for the three NLO diagrams are considered in the time-momentum representation (TMR), following the methodology of Balzani, Laporta, and Passera. For higher-order (HO) corrections involving additional photon or lepton lines, we derive analytical expansions at short Euclidean times and numerical expansions at large times. The NLO contribution with two QCD insertions is analytically integrated, and the resulting expression is then expanded across different regions of the Euclidean time plane. We combine these kernels with vector two-point correlation functions computed on over 30 CLS ensembles with Wilson fermions. To control discretisation effects, we apply two different $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement schemes for the vector current, each using two discretisations, and employ time-window techniques to isolate the continuum-dominant contributions. On each ensemble, we apply finite-volume corrections using both the Hansen-Patella and Meyer-Lellouch-L\u00fcscher approaches to match to a common reference volume, supplemented by a final correction step to infinite volume in the continuum limit. A combined chiral and continuum extrapolation yields our final result for $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{hvp}}[\\mathrm{NLO}]$.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/138038\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arnau","last_name":"Beltran","fullName":"Beltran, Arnau","id":"262846","affiliation":"JGU Mainz","emailHash":"409b7075589f2387d3d92e00636df15b","db_id":262846,"person_id":224677}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arnau","last_name":"Beltran","fullName":"Beltran, Arnau","id":"262846","affiliation":"JGU Mainz","emailHash":"409b7075589f2387d3d92e00636df15b","db_id":262846,"person_id":224677}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Conigli","fullName":"Conigli, Alessandro","id":"262845","affiliation":"JGU Mainz","emailHash":"0be9b3ec7fe1bf5765dfc07ff6460adb","db_id":262845,"person_id":224712},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hartmut","last_name":"Wittig","fullName":"Wittig, Hartmut","id":"262843","affiliation":"","emailHash":"ef6f41051a8d5bc6bac19a821f219661","db_id":262843,"person_id":224710},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Kuberski","fullName":"Kuberski, Simon","id":"262844","affiliation":"","emailHash":"bc3f69a788260c4d9012563d58bc7e2c","db_id":262844,"person_id":224711}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic contribution to the magnetic moment of muon","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2025-11-03","time":"10:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"11:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Lehner","firstName":"Christoph","name":"Lehner, Christoph","last_name":"Lehner","first_name":"Christoph","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"University of Regensburg","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Lehner, Christoph","id":225470,"db_id":12714,"person_id":225470,"emailHash":"7f5a0a517b0efdb137bd9e3e4700bdce"},{"fax":"","familyName":"Krstic Marinkovic","firstName":"Marina","name":"Krstic Marinkovic, Marina","last_name":"Krstic Marinkovic","first_name":"Marina","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"ETH Zurich","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Krstic Marinkovic, Marina","id":227672,"db_id":12712,"person_id":227672,"emailHash":"020872650496da633af8302dd3c9a04b"}],"title":"Hadronic contribution to the magnetic moment of muon","color":"#dfe555","textColor":"#202020","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":"Parallel sessions","url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/sessions\/21215\/","roomFullname":"D406","location":"","address":"","_fossil":"sessionMinimal","numSlots":3,"id":"24","db_id":21215,"friendly_id":24,"room":"D406","code":""},"room":"D406","roomFullname":"D406","location":"","inheritLoc":true,"inheritRoom":true,"slotTitle":"","address":"","conveners":[],"code":""},{"_type":"SessionSlot","_fossil":"sessionMetadata","id":25248,"conference":{"_type":"Conference","id":"14504","title":"42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025)","description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025) will be held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tifr.res.in\/\">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research<\/a>\u00a0(TIFR),\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/eeWfVtmqnzVQFFix9\">Mumbai<\/a>, India, November 2-8, 2025.

corrections to n-point functions on the lattice can be calculated by using a position space photon propagator. In this representation the propagator depends on the difference between the two vertices connected by the internal photon, leading to a volume square sum. The sum can be avoided by fixing one of the vertices to a single point with the downside of drastically reducing the sampling of the vertex. We explore various ways of factorizing the position space photon propagator, which disentangles the dependence on the difference. It allows the sum over all lattice sites for the two vertices connected by the internal photon. \r\n\r\nWe compare the point-source implementation with two methods, where the propagator is factorized, by calculating the isospin violating part of the hadronic vacuum polarization of $(g-2)_\\mu$.

Its long-distance part in particular is a weak point of the current best lattice QCD computations. We compute it to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral perturbaion theory, capturing the lowest-energy hadronic contributions to unprecendentd precision and opening the door for improved control over lattice finite volume effects. The result depends on a small number of low-energy constants, whose values are under control. This calculation pushes the envelope of high-order chiral perturbation theory and of the evaluation of multiloop integrals with massive propagators, thereby extending the toolbox for precision calculations in very low-energy QCD.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.global\/event\/14504\/contributions\/137873\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mattias","last_name":"Sj\u00f6","fullName":"Sj\u00f6, Mattias","id":"262338","affiliation":"CPT Marseille","emailHash":"12c83a5858ee4eb7189f597776451ff2","db_id":262338,"person_id":225693}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mattias","last_name":"Sj\u00f6","fullName":"Sj\u00f6, Mattias","id":"262338","affiliation":"CPT Marseille","emailHash":"12c83a5858ee4eb7189f597776451ff2","db_id":262338,"person_id":225693}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Lupo","fullName":"Lupo, Alessandro","id":"262340","affiliation":"CPT, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9","emailHash":"bb028e28a5224bd4b53d1a0e08baef5f","db_id":262340,"person_id":225696},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kalman","last_name":"Szabo","fullName":"Szabo, Kalman","id":"262337","affiliation":"","emailHash":"d5fb5b49dc468f05c5155399ac714bf2","db_id":262337,"person_id":225404},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Laurent","last_name":"Lellouch","fullName":"Lellouch, Laurent","id":"262341","affiliation":"CNRS and Aix-Marseille U.","emailHash":"155568c543be17930a785f7bb0c09b68","db_id":262341,"person_id":225695},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pierre","last_name":"Vanhove","fullName":"Vanhove, Pierre","id":"262339","affiliation":"Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique -  CEA\/Saclay, France","emailHash":"c874758501394ca7d0d7c4e6d0be9e43","db_id":262339,"person_id":225694}],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Hadronic contribution to the magnetic moment of muon","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"221","db_id":137874,"friendly_id":221,"title":"Hadronic contributions to $\\alpha(Q^2)$ and $\\sin^2\\theta_W(Q^2)$ from spectral reconstruction on the lattice.","startDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"10:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2025-11-04","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"D406","room":"D406","note":{},"location":"","type":"Talk","description":"We present progress towards a new determination of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) function $\\Pi(Q^2)$ relevant for the running of the electromagnetic coupling and the electroweak mixing angle.

At fixed lattice spacing and volume with Nf =1+2+1 dynamical fermions, and fully including sea-quark effects in both computations, we find that simulating the full QCD+QED distribution yields smaller uncertainties for a fixed statistics.
